        "text": "BIRCH, Circuit Judge:\nAppellant ITT Commercial Finance Corporation (\u201cITT\u201d) appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) granting Appellee Virginia Dilkes leave to file a proof of claim after the time set by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) within which all proofs of claims were to be filed (the \u201cbar date\u201d). A creditor may file a proof of claim after the bar date only if the creditor\u2019s failure to file a proof of claim within the specified time was the result of excusable neglect. Because Dilkes has failed to demonstrate that her untimely filing was due to excusable neglect, we REVERSE the decision of the district court.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn January 30,1986, Analytical Systems, Inc. (\u201cDebtor\u201d) filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1174. James Dunning was the chief executive officer, president and sole shareholder of Debtor. Dilkes, married to Dunning at that time, and her wholly-owned company, Computer Business Solutions, Inc. (\u201cCBS\u201d), were scheduled as creditors of Debtor, and received actual notice of Debtor\u2019s bankruptcy filing. The notice instructed creditors to file proofs of claims on or before July 10, 1986 if their claims were listed as disputed, contingent or unliq-uidated, and specified that it was the responsibility of creditors choosing to rely on the schedules to determine their accuracy. When Dilkes questioned Dunning about this notice, he told her that because her claims were scheduled, she did not need to file proofs of claims. However, Dunning did not inform Dilkes that her individual claim had been reduced on Debtor\u2019s books from approximately $378,872 to approximately $51,456.\nIn July, 1987, while going through a divorce with Dunning, Dilkes discovered that her individual claim against Debtor had been scheduled for $51,456 and as without dispute. Thus, on September 18, 1987, more than fourteen months after the bar date for filing proofs of claims, Dilkes filed a proof of claim in the amount of $378,872 and a motion to allow her claim. Debtor and ITT, the principal unsecured creditor, objected, thereby bringing the issue before the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn an order dated August 31, 1988, the Bankruptcy Court held that Dilkes\u2019 reliance on Dunning did not constitute excusable neglect. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court stated:\nIn the present case, there has been no showing of excusable neglect. The evidence shows that Ms. Dilkes spoke with Mr. Dunning concerning the schedules and Mr. Dunning confirmed the provision of the court\u2019s order and notice that a proof of claim need not be filed if she was scheduled and the claim was not disputed. This was true. No evidence was presented that any information of a misleading nature was communicated by Mr. Dunning. The most that can be said is that Mr. Dunning did not affirmatively state the amount of Mrs. Dilkes\u2019 claim. There is no evidence that any inquiry was ever made by Ms. Dilkes regarding the amount of her claim. Ms. Dilkes is an educated and knowledgeable lady who appears to have understood the notices she received.\nITT Commercial Finance Corp. v. Dilkes (In re Analytical Systems, Inc.), Ch. 11 Case No. 86-00688-SWC, at 3 (N.D.Ga. Aug. 31, 1988). Thus, the Bankruptcy Court disallowed Dilkes\u2019 late-filed proof of claim to the extent it exceeded $51,456, the undisputed amount for which it was scheduled.\nDilkes filed a motion for reconsideration of this order in the Bankruptcy Court, claiming that her untimely filing was due to excusable neglect based on Dunning\u2019s violation of their confidential marital relationship. In an order dated November 8, 1988, the Bankruptcy Court granted Dilkes\u2019 motion for reconsideration and granted a new trial on the substantive objections to Dilkes\u2019 proof of claim raised by Debtor and ITT. 97 B.R. 676. The Bankruptcy Court found that Dunning\u2019s failure to inform Dilkes of the reduction of her claim on Debtor\u2019s books constituted a breach of the confidential marital relationship that exists under Georgia law between husband and wife, and a breach of Dunning\u2019s duty, as the debtor in possession, to deal fairly with Debtor\u2019s creditors. Because the breach of these spousal and fiduciary duties were found to constitute excusable neglect, the Bankruptcy Court allowed the filing of Dilkes\u2019 untimely proof of claim.\nITT appealed to the District Court from the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order. In its January 3, 1990 order affirming the decision of the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court made several findings. After recognizing the existence of a confidential marital relationship between husband and wife which allows one spouse to rely on representations made by the other, the District Court found that Dunning had breached this relationship by not informing Dilkes that the amount of her claim had been reduced. Moreover, because the marital relationship should not be undermined by establishing a policy discouraging trust and reliance between spouses, the District Court found that a breach of this spousal duty carries over to the business relationship between a husband and wife as debtor and creditor. The District Court noted that the Bankruptcy Court had made no explicit findings of fraud perpetrated by Dunning, but interpreted the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding that Dunning had breached the confidential marital relationship as a finding of constructive fraud. 113 B.R. 91. This finding was used by the District Court to support its conclusion that Dilkes\u2019 untimely filing of her proof of claim was due to excusable neglect.\nWe now consider ITT\u2019s appeal from the District Court\u2019s order.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA proof of claim is a \u201cwritten statement setting forth a creditor\u2019s claim[,]\u201d Bankruptcy Rule 3001, which creditors must file with the bankruptcy court in order for their claims to be allowed. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501, Bankruptcy Rule 3002. A proof of claim is deemed filed for any claim that appears in the schedules filed by the debtor with the bankruptcy court. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(a). It is the creditor\u2019s responsibility to verify the accuracy of his claim as listed on the debtor\u2019s schedules, Advisory Committee Note to Bankruptcy Rule 3003, and a creditor whose claim is not scheduled, scheduled improperly or scheduled as disputed, contingent or unliq-uidated must file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court within the time fixed by that court. Bankruptcy Rule 3003(c).\nBankruptcy Rule 3003(c)(3) provides that a bankruptcy court may extend the time within which a proof of claim must be filed \u201cfor cause shown.\u201d This rule must be read in conjunction with Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b), which explains under what circumstances a bankruptcy court may, in its discretion, extend the bar date. Biscayne 21 Condominium Assoc., Inc. v. South Atlantic Financial Corp. (In re South Atlantic Financial Cory.), 767 F.2d 814, 817 (11th Cir.1985). When a motion to extend time is made after the bar date, a bankruptcy court may permit the extension if the delay was the result of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b). Thus, the issue in this case is whether Dilkes\u2019 reliance on Dunning\u2019s statements constitutes excusable neglect.\nThis court has interpreted the excusable neglect standard to require the movant to establish that \u201cthe failure to timely perform a duty was due to circumstances which were beyond the reasonable control of the person whose duty it was to perform.\u201d Id. (quoting In re Gem Rail Corp., 12 B.R. 929, 931 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. 1981)). Dilkes\u2019 failure to file her proof of claim before the bar date was not due to circumstances beyond her reasonable control and thus did not meet the standard for excusable neglect. Dilkes received, read and understood the notices from the Bankruptcy Court regarding the filing of proofs of claims. It was her duty as a creditor to determine the accuracy of her claim as listed in Debtor\u2019s schedules. This clearly was within her reasonable control.\nFurthermore, we will not allow the late filing of Dilkes\u2019 proof of claim solely on the grounds of equity. A movant may not bypass the \u201cbeyond the reasonable control\u201d standard by relying on general principles of equity. See Vertientes, Ltd. v. Internor Trade, Inc. (In re Vertientes, Ltd.), 845 F.2d 57, 60 (3d Cir.1988) (Although creditor did not believe it necessary to file a proof of claim, creditor was not permitted to file a late proof of claim because \u201c[t]he [bankruptcy] court has no discretion to grant an extension simply because no prejudice would result, or for any other equitable reason.\u201d); Maressa v. A.H. Robins Co., Inc., 839 F.2d 220, 221 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 826, 109 S.Ct. 76, 102 L.Ed.2d 53 (1988) (\u201cThe clear Congressional intent to require filing of valid proofs of claims within the established time limits precludes any exceptions based on general equitable principles.\u201d); In re South Atlantic Financial Corp., 767 F.2d at 818 (\u201c[Cjounsel\u2019s failure accurately to determine whether a proof of claim had already been filed, a fact she could easily have verified by an examination of the bankruptcy court records[,]\u201d did not constitute excusable neglect.) (discussing In re Underground Utility Construction Co., 35 B.R. 588 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1983) (Filing of proof of claim three days after the bar date because proof of claim not mailed to proper address did not constitute excusable neglect.); In re Horn Construction & Maintenance, 32 B.R. 87 (Bankr.S.D.Ala.1983) (Late filing of proof of claim because of \u201cmisunderstanding\" between creditor and creditor\u2019s attorney did not constitute excusable neglect.); In re Oakton Beach & Tennis Club Real Estate Ltd. Partnership, 9 B.R. 201 (Bankr.E.D.Wisc.1981) (Counsel\u2019s reliance on misinformation from bankruptcy court clerk did not constitute excusable neglect.)). Thus, any breach of the confidential marital relationship between husband and wife resulting from Dilkes\u2019 reliance on Dunning\u2019s statements does not constitute excusable neglect.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nDilkes\u2019 failure to file a proof of claim within the time specified by the Bankruptcy Court was not due to excusable neglect. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in granting Dilkes leave to file an untimely proof of claim. We REVERSE the order of the District Court allowing Dilkes\u2019 untimely proof of claim, and REMAND this case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to allow Dilkes\u2019 claim in the scheduled amount plus interest as specified in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s original order dated August 31, 1988.\n. The circumstances surrounding the reduction of Dilkes\u2019 claim on Debtor's corporate books are not clear. There has been no finding by the courts below as to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of this reduction.\n. Section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a proof of claim is deemed allowed unless a party in interest objects. Thus, Debt- or\u2019s and ITT\u2019s objections to Dilkes\u2019 claim brought this motion in issue.\n. The CBS proof of claim was withdrawn at that time and is not at issue in this case.\n. In a bankruptcy case, the debtor files with the bankruptcy court schedules of assets and liabilities and a list of creditors. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521, Bankruptcy Rule 1007(a), (b).\n. The practical, commercial rationale underlying the need for a bar date are manifest. The creditors and bankruptcy court must be able to rely on a fixed financial position of the debtor in order to evaluate intelligently the proposed plan of reorganization for plan approval or amendment purpose. After initiating a carefully orchestrated plan of reorganization, the untimely interjection of an unanticipated claim, particularly a relatively large one, can destroy the fragile balance struck by all the interested parties in the plan. Given the time sensitivity of such financial undertakings, the consequent delay in reevaluation necessitated by the late allowance of the claim often may spell disaster to recovery, even where ultimate approval is forthcoming. These considerations and realities militate in favor of restraint and caution in allowing untimely claims. See Hoos & Co. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 570 F.2d 433, 439 (2d Cir.1978).\n. The record below is devoid of any evidence of actual fraud. It never was demonstrated that Dunning was aware, at the time of his representations to Dilkes, of any improper discrepancy between the original debt amount and that scheduled. Moreover, in the context of contemporary life where husbands and wives frequently are pursuing respective business and professional lives that intersect on a commercial level, any other rule would ignore the separation of home and office implicit in the rules of commercial conduct (and common sense) reflected in the Bankruptcy Code and Rules.",
