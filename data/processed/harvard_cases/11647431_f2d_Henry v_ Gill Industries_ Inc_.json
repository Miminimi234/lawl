        "text": "O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\nIn this appeal and cross-appeal we must .decide whether a civil action can be dismissed as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery rules and whether a summary judgment motion on a counterclaim can be granted based solely on failure of the opposing party to file an answering memorandum under local court rules.\nI\nDel P. Henry, Jr., (\u201cHenry\u201d) brought suit against Gill Industries, Inc. (\u201cGill\u201d) in January 1989 for alleged misconduct in connection with a 1985 securities transaction. Gill counterclaimed alleging that Henry\u2019s suit breached a settlement agreement between them. The proceedings did not run smoothly. In January 1990, the district court ordered Henry to pay attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for discovery misconduct in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(d). In March 1991, the court dismissed Henry\u2019s suit with prejudice for \u201crepeated noncompliance with discovery rules.\u201d Henry filed a timely notice of appeal. The district court then granted partial summary judgment against Gill on its counterclaim. Gill filed a timely notice of cross-appeal.\nII\nThe district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees against Henry under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(d), which permits an award of such \u201creasonable\u201d fees as are \u201ccaused by\u201d a failure to engage in discovery. Henry does not dispute the propriety of the district court's decision to impose sanctions. Rather, he argues that a proper evidentiary foundation for determining the amount of the award was never laid, and that the award must therefore be vacated.\n\u201cAn appeal from a district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. The court abuses its discretion when it bases the award on clearly erroneous legal or factual findings.\u201d Drucker v. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Moving and Storage, Inc., 963 F.2d 1171, 1173 (9th Cir.1992) (citations omitted).\nHenry argues that Gill was \u201crequired to provide detailed time and expense records\u201d to meet its burden of establishing its entitlement to fees, and that the affidavits of Gill\u2019s counsel on which the district court based its award were inadequate. Our precedents, however, have clearly established that an award of attorney\u2019s fees may be based on the affidavits of counsel, so long as they are \u201csufficiently detailed to enable the court to consider all the factors necessary in setting the fees.\u201d Williams v. Alioto, 625 F.2d 845, 849 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981); accord Sablan v. Department of Fin. of N. Mariana Islands, 856 F.2d 1317, 1322 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201csufficiently detailed to provide an adequate basis for calculating the award\u201d); Shakey\u2019s Inc. v. Covalt, 704 F.2d 426, 435 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cample evidence to support the attorney\u2019s fee award\u201d); Manhart v. City of Los Angeles, 652 F.2d 904, 908 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201csufficiently detailed to provide a basis for the award\u201d), vacated on other grounds, 461 U.S. 951, 103 S.Ct. 2420, 77 L.Ed.2d 1310 (1983).\nThe district court expressly found that Gill\u2019s declarations and affidavits satisfied this requirement. The relevant documents disclosed the nature of the services rendered in connection with unavailing efforts to obtain discovery, the amount of attorney time so consumed, and the rates at which this time was billed to the client. The court noted that any doubts it may have had regarding the sufficiency of the documentation submitted in support of the fee application had been obviated by awarding only one-third of the amount of fees requested by Gill. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court committed clear error in finding that the fees awarded were \u201ccaused by\u201d Henry\u2019s discovery misconduct and represented \u201creasonable\u201d charges for the services of Gill\u2019s counsel. The award therefore did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIll\nA\nWe turn now to Henry\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s eventual dismissal of his suit as a sanction under Rule 37 for \u201crepeated and flagrant\u201d discovery abuses was unwarranted.\n\u201cWe review the imposition of discovery sanctions under Rule 37 for abuse of discretion. The district court\u2019s discretion will not be disturbed unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors. Where the drastic sanctions of dismissal or default are imposed, however, the range of discretion is narrowed and the losing party\u2019s non-compliance must be due to willfulness, fault, or bad faith.\u201d Fjelstad v. American Honda Motor Co., 762 F.2d 1334, 1337 (9th Cir.1985) (citations and internal punctuation omitted).\nHenry offers a number of challenges to the legal and factual premises on which the district court proceeded in ordering dismissal under Rule 87. None has merit.\nAs a threshold matter, Henry appears to suggest that only so much of his discovery conduct as occurred after the court\u2019s imposition of monetary sanctions should have been considered in deciding whether dismissal was warranted. This circuit\u2019s law is to the contrary. See Adriana Int\u2019l Corp. v. Thoeren, 913 F.2d 1406, 1411 (9th Cir.1990) (district court properly considered all of defendant\u2019s discovery conduct in ordering default judgment: \u201cIn evaluating the propriety of sanctions, we look at all incidents of a party\u2019s misconduct.\u201d), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1019, 112 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1991); Halaco Eng\u2019g Co. v. Costle, 843 F.2d 376, 381 n. 2 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201ccourt may indeed consider prior conduct that has already been subject to sanction, when it is weighing a subsequent sanction motion\u201d).\nNext, Henry argues that he never \u201cfailed to appear\u201d for his noticed deposition because each such deposition was vacated by agreement of the parties. He suggests that \u201cthe ordinary difficulties in coordinating calendars\u201d should not be grounds for discovery sanctions. The record shows, however, and the district court found that Henry \u201ctwice notified defendants the business day before his properly noticed depositions were to have taken place that he would not attend....\u201d Henry thus asks this court to hold that, even though he twice forced cancellation of his deposition by notifying Gill at the last minute that he would not appear, such conduct does not constitute a \u201cfailure to appear\u201d because Gill\u2019s counsel, instead of sitting in a conference room waiting for Henry not to arrive, attempted to reschedule the deposition. We reject the suggestion that an unreasonable refusal to be deposed must be met with an unreasonable refusal to reschedule in order to warrant sanctions under Rule 37.\nNext, Henry suggests that, even if he was guilty of \u201csome failure\u201d with regard to the scheduling of his deposition, \u201cthat failure [was] purged by ... his submitting to ... deposition_\u201d He cites no authority for this proposition, and, indeed, this court has- squarely rejected it. See North Am. Watch Corp. v. Princess Ermine Jewels, 786 F.2d 1447, 1451 (9th Cir.1986) (order of dismissal affirmed: \u201cBelated compliance with discovery orders does not preclude the imposition of sanctions.\u201d); G-K Properties v. Redevelopment Agency of San Jose, 577 F.2d 645, 647-48 (9th Cir.1978) (order of dismissal affirmed: \u201clast minute tender\u201d of discovery does not cure effects of discovery misconduct).\nNext, Henry challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he \u201cfailed to submit a complete response to [Gill\u2019s] Request for Production of Documents.... \u201d Henry asserts that he \u201cmade full and complete production of all responsive documents ... many months before [Gill] filed [its] first motion to compel,\u201d and that in this respect the court\u2019s order of sanctions was based on \u201cimagined and unsubstantiated deficiencies in his document production.\u201d Henry cannot, however, demonstrate clear error in the district court\u2019s finding just by disagreeing with it. The record indicates, for example, that Henry failed to produce a copy of his 1986 tax return until some time after his suit had been dismissed, and failed to produce either a legible copy or the original of certain key documents repeatedly requested by Gill. Henry argues that his failure to produce these documents caused Gill no prejudice, but this, even if true, would not establish that his conduct did not violate the discovery rules.\nFinally, Henry insists that he complied fully with the district court\u2019s orders with respect to payment of the monetary sanctions. He apparently sees no inconsistency between this claim and his failure to dispute the court's finding to the contrary. The court found that Henry \u201cfailed to comply with the Court\u2019s ... order for discovery sanctions by depositing with the Court clerk a non-negotiable certificate of deposit made out to plaintiff\u2019s own lawyer instead of a negotiable certificate of deposit.\u201d The district court, in approving the posting of a supersedeas bond, expressly required use of a \u201cnegotiable\u201d certificate of deposit. The court was justified in thinking its order entitled to be obeyed in all particulars. Henry\u2019s contention that he had an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to post a bond rather than pay over the amount of the sanction to Gill has nothing to do with whether the court\u2019s order as to the form of the bond was heeded.\nB\nHaving disposed of these preliminaries, we turn to the question whether dismissal of Henry\u2019s action was proper. \u201cBecause the sanction of dismissal is such a harsh penalty, the district court must weigh five factors before imposing dismissal: (1) the public\u2019s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need to manage its dockets; (3) the risk of prejudice to the party seeking sanctions; (4) the public policy favoring disposition of eases on their merits; and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions.\u201d Porter v. Martinez, 941 F.2d 732, 733 (9th Cir.1991) (citations and internal punctuation omitted). \u201cThe first two of these factors favor the imposition of sanctions in most cases, while the fourth cuts against a ... dismissal sanction. Thus the key factors are prejudice and the availability of lesser sanctions.\u201d Wanderer v. Johnston, 910 F.2d 652, 656 (9th Cir.1990).\nHenry argues that Gill suffered no prejudice by reason of his discovery misconduct because, eventually, Gill received all the discovery it had sought. We have noted, however, that \u201c[a] defendant suffers prejudice if the plaintiff\u2019s actions impair the defendant\u2019s ability to go to trial or threaten to interfere with the rightful decision of the case.\u201d Adriana, 913 F.2d at 1412. Here, the district court concluded that the lengthy delays caused by Henry\u2019s refusal to engage in discovery had \u201cirreparably prejudiced\u201d Gill. The source of this prejudice was the fact that Allen T. Gilli-land, one of the defendants and the only participant in the conversations with Henry that formed the basis of Henry\u2019s lawsuit, became unable to assist with the defense of the case. Gilliland was diagnosed with a brain tumor in June 1990. By October 1990, some nineteen months after Henry\u2019s suit had been filed, Gilliland had had two brain surgeries, and was no longer able to participate in the defense. Gilliland died in February 1991.\nHenry argues that he \u201cwas not responsible for Gilliland\u2019s death and he cannot logically be charged with any \u2018prejudice\u2019 that allegedly resulted from his demise.\u201d However, Henry was responsible for the fact that the case had not progressed further at the time Gilliland became unable to assist with the defense. Because Gilliland became unavailable well before discovery was complete, and, indeed, before Gilliland\u2019s deposition had been finished, Henry\u2019s actions prejudiced Gill\u2019s ability to mount a defense. Furthermore, there is every reason to believe that this prejudice would in turn have threatened to interfere with the rightful decision of the case, since whatever it was that passed between Henry and Gilliland in 1985 would apparently have been the key to the jury\u2019s decision. In short, the prejudice factor weighed in favor of dismissal.\nAs for the availability of a lesser sanction, the district court noted that lesser sanctions had been tried, and had failed. There was no reason to expect that Henry would respond more satisfactorily to a second round of intermediate sanctions than he did to the first. Thus, both of the \u201ckey factors\u201d in our five-factor test here pointed towards dismissal as the appropriate sanction.\nHenry argues, however, that his conduct did not rise to the level of \u201cwillfulness, bad faith, or fault\u201d necessary to justify dismissal. This argument is without merit. This court has stated that \u201cdisobedient conduct not shown to be outside the control of the litigant\u201d is all that is required to demonstrate willfulness, bad faith, or fault. Fjelstad, 762 F.2d at 1341. Henry offers various explanations for his discovery misconduct, but all are either legally irrelevant or factually implausible, and none persuades that circumstances outside his control caused his transgressions.\nHis failure to answer Gill\u2019s first set of interrogatories or to submit to deposition for eight months in 1989 Henry puts down to his inability to reach an understanding on a formal retainer agreement with counsel after her law firm disbanded, and the fact that he was out of town on business. Such matters are hardly \u201coutside the control of the litigant.\u201d See United Artists Corp. v. La Cage Aux Folies, 771 F.2d 1265, 1270 (9th Cir.1985) (order of dismissal affirmed: that plaintiffs \u201ctravel schedule\u201d prevented him from answering interrogatories for three months \u201cindicated a lack of diligence in keeping abreast of the status of his case,\u201d and did not excuse failure to answer).\nWe have already noted Henry\u2019s explanation for his refusal to appear on two separate occasions for his properly noticed deposition. His claim that the depositions were continued by agreement of counsel, once rejected, leaves no basis for concluding that his failures to appear were not similarly within his control.\nFinally, Henry tries to explain his failure to respond to Gill\u2019s second set of interrogatories as the result of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d between counsel. Henry claims that his counsel was under the impression that the time to answer had been extended by Gill\u2019s counsel until after completion of the Gilliland deposition (which, of course, was never completed). That she could have entertained such a belief is doubtful in light of the fact that at least two letters were sent by Gill demanding the interrogatories and claiming they were overdue. Having ignored such correspondence, Henry cannot be heard to say that this second failure to answer was beyond his control.\nIn sum, all of the factors required by circuit law in order to justify dismissal were present in this case. The record thus amply supports the conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Henry\u2019s suit.\nIV\nWe come now to Gill\u2019s cross-appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of Henry\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on its counterclaim. Gill\u2019s opposition to Henry\u2019s motion was due on April 9, 1991. Gill timely filed its opposition papers with the court, but, for reasons that need not concern us here, Gill failed to serve Henry with copies of those papers by the established deadline. Gill thereby violated Local Rule ll(i) of the District Court of Arizona, which provides that \u201cif the opposing party does not serve and file the required answering memoran-da ... such non-compliance may be deemed a consent to the denial or granting of the motion summarily.\u201d D.Ariz.R. ll(i) (emphasis supplied). The district court applied this rule according to its terms, and treated Gill\u2019s failure to serve Henry with its opposition to the summary judgment motion as consent to the granting of that motion. The question before us is whether the court erred in doing so.\nWe have previously observed that \u201cit is highly questionable in light of the standards of [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 56 that a local rule can mandate the granting of summary judgment for the movant based on a failure to file opposing papers where the movant\u2019s papers are themselves insufficient to support a motion for summary judgment or on their face reveal a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Hamilton v. Keystone Tankship Corp., 539 F.2d 684, 686 n. 1 (9th Cir.1976); accord Mutual Fund Investors, Inc. v. Putnam Management Co., 553 F.2d 620, 625 (9th Cir.1977).\nThe doubts expressed in these cases were founded on an appreciation of the interrelationship between Rule 56 and Rule 83. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83 invites the district courts to formulate local rules, but only insofar as they are not inconsistent with the federal rules themselves. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a moving party is entitled to summary judgment only upon a showing that there are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. The party opposing the motion is under no obligation to offer affidavits or any other materials in support of its opposition. Summary judgment may be resisted and must be denied on no other grounds than that the movant has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the absence of triable issues. A local rule that requires the entry of summary judgment simply because no papers opposing the motion are filed or served, and without regard to whether genuine issues of material fact exist, would be inconsistent with Rule 56, hence impermissible under Rule 83. See Hibernia Nat\u2019l Bank v. Administracion Central Sociedad Anonima, 776 F.2d 1277, 1279 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cA motion for summary judgment cannot be granted simply because there is no opposition, even if the failure to oppose violated a local rule.\u201d).\nIn this case, as in Hamilton and Mutual Fund Investors, the local rule at issue does not require the court to grant a motion for summary judgment when the non-moving party fails to file and/or serve its opposition thereto. The language of the rule is permissive, conferring discretion upon the district judge to determine whether non-compliance should be deemed consent to a given motion. That discretion, however, is necessarily abused when exercised to grant a motion for summary judgment where the movant\u2019s papers are insufficient to support that motion or on their face reveal a genuine issue of material fact.\nApplying this standard to the case at hand, it is clear that the district court erred in entering partial summary judgment against Gill solely on the basis of the local rule violation. We may affirm, however, on any basis supported by the record. United States v. Washington, 969 F.2d 752, 755 (9th Cir.1992). We believe the grant of summary judgment was in order. Gill claimed that Henry\u2019s suit breached his agreement not to commence any action asserting obligations \u201cthat arise out of the payment of any dividends by [Gill]. Henry\u2019s action for Rule 10(b)(5) violations, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty was premised on Gill\u2019s alleged attempts to squeeze him out of the corporation by forcing him to sell his shares on less favorable terms than were afforded to other stockholders. The damages that Henry sought were based on the difference between the price at which he was required to sell and the price he would have received had he been provided the same terms as other shareholders. He did not claim any damages based on the nonpayment of dividends. It is true that the complaint refers to Gill\u2019s failure to pay a dividend. However, this reference appears in a list of several activities which allegedly manifested Gill\u2019s intent to disenfranchise Henry and does not turn Henry\u2019s action into one \u201caris[ing] out of the payment of any dividends.\u201d At bottom, Gill\u2019s counterclaim was frivolous and was therefore properly disposed of on summary judgment.\nAFFIRMED.\n. Henry argues that Gill\u2019s affidavits, because they set forth information detailed at greater length in counsel's contemporaneous time records, are \"summaries\u201d of those records subject to the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 1006. No authority is cited to support this argument, and, in view of Henry\u2019s failure even to mention Williams and its progeny, let alone to discredit those cases, we reject it without further discussion.",
