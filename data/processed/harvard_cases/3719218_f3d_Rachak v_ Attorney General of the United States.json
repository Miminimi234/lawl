        "text": "OPINION\nCHAGARES, Circuit Judge.\nTarik Rachak petitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) order deeming him ineligible for cancellation of removal and affirming the denial of a continuance. We will dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.\nI.\nRachak, who is a citizen of Morocco, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in August of 2002. In 2006, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana under 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 780-113(a)(31). Rachak was placed on probation with supervision under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cAccelerated Rehabilitative Disposition\u201d program, Administrative Record (\u201cA.R.\u201d) 217, but did not comply with the conditions of the program. Thereafter, the state court terminated Rachak\u2019s participation in the program and on February 16, 2011, Rachak pled guilty to the charge arising out of his 2006 marijuana possession arrest. A.R. 214-16.\nOn July 20, 2011, Rachak pled guilty to charges of possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia under 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 780-113(a)(16) and (a)(32) in the York County Court of Common Pleas. He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of twelve months of probation. A.R. 186-202.\nOn September 29, 2011, the Department of Homeland Security charged Rachak with being removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) because he had been convicted of a controlled substance offense in July 2011. Rachak then filed a Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) petition attacking his July 2011 conviction. For a time, he successfully sought immigration continuances while he mounted his collateral attack, although the Government opposed some of these requests.\nAt a hearing on May 24, 2012, Rachak\u2019s attorney advised the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) that his PCRA petition had been denied at the trial level \u201calmost a month ago,\u201d but was currently on appeal before the Pennsylvania Superior Court. A.R. 119. The IJ issued an oral decision declining to grant any further continuances. In addition, the IJ ordered Rachak removed and noted that his 2006 conduct rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) because he had not accrued seven years of continuous residence in the United States. A.R. 63-65. The BIA affirmed, A.R. 3-5, and this timely petition for review followed.\nRachak does not argue that the final order of removal itself was erroneously granted. Instead, Rachak contends that the IJ and BIA wrongly determined that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. He also contends that his motion for an additional continuance should have been granted.\nII.\nWe must first address the scope of our jurisdiction. Because Rachak is a criminal alien found removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), our review of the agency\u2019s determination is limited to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D). To fall under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)\u2019s grant of jurisdiction, an issue must be either a \u201cpurely legal inquir[y]\u201d or raise a \u201ccolorable\u201d claim that a constitutional violation has occurred. Roye v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., 693 F.3d 333, 339 (3d Cir.2012).\nA.\nThe first issue Rachak raises in this appeal is whether he was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal. We hold that this issue involves a purely legal question concerning the operation of the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(B). See Baraket v. Holder, 632 F.3d 56, 58 (2d Cir.2011) (per curiam) (\u201cThis appeal presents solely a question of law: how to properly interpret 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l).\u201d). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to consider whether Rachak was eligible for cancellation of removal.\nB.\nNext we examine whether we have jurisdiction to consider Rachak\u2019s argument that the IJ \u201cerred in denying a continuance in this case, and the BIA erred in affirming this decision.\u201d Rachak Br. 19. We have never issued a precedential opinion deciding whether we have jurisdiction to review claims of this sort in the constrained context of criminal-alien petitions. However, our case law provides helpful guideposts to resolve this issue.\nThe denial of a motion for a continuance is discretionary. Khan v. Att\u2019y Gen., of U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir.2006). We have held that discretionary decisions, as here, do \u201cnot raise a constitutional claim or question of law covered by [\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)\u2019s] judicial review provision.\u201d Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 627, 635 (3d Cir.2006); see Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., 483 F.3d 184, 188 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201c[I]t is clear that courts of appeals continue to have no jurisdiction to review discretionary and factual determinations presented in petitions for review.\u201d). Specifically, we have recognized that \u201c[djespite the special treatment accorded constitutional claims and questions of law, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) does not exempt ... discretionary challenges from the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the [Immigration and Nationality Act].\u201d Sukwanputra, 434 F.3d at 634. See generally Jarbough, 483 F.3d at 190 (\u201cRecasting challenges to factual or discretionary determinations as due process or other constitutional claims is clearly insufficient to give this Court jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d).\nAs a result, we conclude that we have no jurisdiction over Rachak\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion for a continuance. We note that our holding today is in accord with those of our sister Courts of Appeals. See, e.g., Waugh v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 (10th Cir.2011) (\u201c[Petitioner also argues the IJ and BIA erred in denying his request to continue the removal proceedings until his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was resolved in state court.... This challenge raises neither a constitutional nor a legal issue, so we are without jurisdiction to review it.\u201d); Ogunfuye v. Holder, 610 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that petitioner\u2019s \u201cargument that the IJ abused its discretion by not granting her a continuance does not present a constitutional claim or issue of law that this court has jurisdiction to consider\u201d); Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 524 F.3d 1191, 1197 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the denial of a continuance is discretionary and that the court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to review such a denial).\nAccordingly, because we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of a continuance, we will dismiss this petition for review in part.\nIII.\nWe exercise de novo review of the agency\u2019s interpretation of the stop-time provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(B), subject to applicable principles of deference. See Briseno-Flores v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., 492 F.3d 226, 228 (3d Cir.2007). Since the BIA issued its own decision on the merits of this claim, we review only its decision. Hanif v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., 694 F.3d 479, 483 (3d Cir.2012).\nThe Attorney General may cancel removal of a permanent-resident alien who is otherwise inadmissible or deportable if, inter alia, the alien has \u201cresided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). The statute terminates the accrual of the period of residence when the alien has \u201ccommitted an offense\u201d that renders him either inadmissible or removable. Id. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B). Once the period of continuous residence is terminated, it is not restarted by subsequent events. See Briseno-Flores, 492 F.3d at 230-31. The parties agree that the 2006 conduct did not render Rachak removable, but it did plainly render him inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) because it was \u201ca violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance.\u201d\nTacitly conceding his inadmissibility, Rachak contends that because \u201ca waiver was available to Petitioner to waive the inadmissibility under this provision,\u201d the \u201c2006 offense did not stop the clock on the requisite seven (7) years of continuous residency in the U.S.\u201d Rachak Br. 15. Specifically, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) permits the Attorney General to waive the inadmissibility of an alien in certain circumstances relating \u201cto a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d But Rachak\u2019s argument suffers from a fatal flaw: he did not apply for this waiver before the agency, and indeed the record suggests that he has not invoked it before now. The mere existence of the waiver provision is immaterial to our analysis.\nWe can discern no reason to disturb the BIA\u2019s stop-time decision as we agree that Rachak did not possess the required seven years of continuous residence for the purpose of applying for cancellation of removal. As a result, we will deny the remainder of the petition for review.\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.\n. The Pennsylvania Superior Court subsequently affirmed the denial of his PCRA petition. Pennsylvania v. Rachak, 62 A.3d 389 (Pa.Super.Ct.2012). Rachak\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal was denied by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Pennsylvania v. Rac-hak, 67 A.3d 796 (Pa.2013).\n. Rachak does not contend that the denial of his motion for a continuance constituted a purely legal question and he did not directly argue that the denial raised a constitutional issue. To the extent Rachak might have raised a due process claim flowing from the fact that the Pennsylvania appellate courts had not yet ruled on his PCRA challenge, it would have failed as we have held that the pendency of a collateral attack on a conviction does not negate the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes. See Paredes v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., 528 F.3d 196, 198-99 (3d Cir.2008). Of course, the agency is free to take the pendency of those matters into account when ruling on continuance motions.\n. Rachak's principal argument in support of our jurisdiction is based on Khan, where we noted that \"we have jurisdiction to review an IJ's denial of a continuance.\u201d 448 F.3d at 233. In so doing, we held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which creates a jurisdictional bar for the review of decisions \"specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security,\u201d did not apply to the denial of a continuance \"[b]ecause the IJ\u2019s authority to rule on a continuance motion is not specified under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1378] to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). Here, as in Khan, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not bar review of the denial of a continuance. Rather, the subsection applicable to this case is \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), which deprives us of jurisdiction if the final order of removal is due to the commission of certain criminal offenses. Khan was not a criminal-alien case.\n.
