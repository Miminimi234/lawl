        "text": "OPINION\nALARC\u00d3N, Senior Circuit Judge:\nThe City of Eugene and Eugene Police Department (EPD) Chief of Police Peter Kerns, Lieutenant Jennifer Bills, and Sergeant Tom Eichhorn appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL). Hagen alleged Appellants violated his First Amendment rights when they removed him from his position on the EPD K-9 team in retaliation for repeatedly airing concerns about work-related safety issues to his supervisors. After a two-day trial, a jury found in Hagen\u2019s favor against all Appellants. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\nWe conclude that the evidence presented to the jury does not reasonably permit the conclusion that Hagen established a First Amendment retaliation claim. Where, as here, a public employee reports departmental-safety concerns to his or her supervisors pursuant to a duty to do so, that employee does not speak as a private citizen and is not entitled to First Amendment protection. We reverse the judgment below and hold that Appellants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nI\nA\nBrian Hagen began working for the EPD in 1998, where he joined the K-9 unit in 2004. As a K-9 officer, Hagen occasionally deployed with the SWAT team for potentially dangerous operations.\nAs early as the late 1990s, the EPD SWAT team began experiencing problems with officers negligently discharging firearms. In an early example, Sergeant Jay Shadwick \u2014 who supervised the K-9 team when Hagen joined in 2004 \u2014 was shot by a SWAT team sniper during an operation in 2001.\nThe accidental discharges continued after Hagen joined the K-9 team. In 2005, a SWAT team officer unintentionally pulled the trigger on his rifle as he attempted to pull the pin on a flash-bang grenade during the execution of a search warrant. The rifle was aimed at the ground. Nobody was hurt. Following that incident, Hagen and his fellow K-9 officers, Mark Hubbard and Robert Rosales, voiced concern over the accident to their supervisor, Sgt. Tom Eichorn.\nIn January 2007, a SWAT officer accidentally shot another officer when he mishandled his rifle while climbing a fence. The following week, Eichhorn met briefly with officers Hagen, Hubbard, and Rosales to further address their safety concerns. When pressed for details about EPD\u2019s proposed response to their safety concerns, Eichhorn became irritated and expressed frustration that the issue was being raised again. After that meeting, Hagen voluntarily took the lead among the K-9 officers in coordinating their complaints.\nIn April 2007, another SWAT officer unintentionally discharged his rifle during the execution of a search warrant due to a technical malfunction, this time in a residential neighborhood. In an effort to make his growing safety concerns \u201cas public as possible\u201d following this third shooting in two years, Hagen sent an e-mail on May 23, 2007, to a number of sergeants with K-9 and SWAT team experience, inviting them to a meeting at city hall on May 30, 2007, to discuss \u201csafety issues related to our close working relationship with the SWAT team.\u201d \u201cMost of these issues,\u201d the e-mail explained, \u201csurround the recent accidental discharges and how [the K-9 and SWAT] teams could be better equipped or trained to function more safely together.\u201d The record is unclear whether this meeting took place on May 30, 2007, as requested. Three days after Hagen e-mailed this invitation, then-Chief of Police Robert Lehner suspended SWAT operations so that safety issues could be resolved.\nOn June 13, while SWAT operations were still suspended, Hagen met at city hall with Hubbard and Rosales from the K-9 team, Lt. Aguilar, and Sgt. Eichhorn to address negligent-discharge concerns. The SWAT team was reactivated on June 20, 2007. By early 2008, Hagen and his fellow K-9 officers still had received no detailed information about improvements to the SWAT team\u2019s weapons handling.\nA meeting was held in April 2008 between the SWAT and K-9 teams, including Sgt. Eichhorn. Hagen again reiterated his safety concerns regarding the accidental weapon discharges. Sgt. Eichhorn became noticeably uncomfortable when those present asked him to whom he had been relaying Hagen\u2019s repeated complaints.\nOn May 28, 2008, Sgt. Eichhorn informed Hagen that he would be transferred out of the K-9 unit to a new patrol team. Sgt. Eichhorn explained that he chose to transfer Hagen, as opposed to K-9 officers Hubbard or Rosales, because Hagen was \u201cthe spokesman for the majority of the complaints,\u201d had a low activity level, and \u201crepeatedly engaged in what [Sgt. Eichhorn deemed] to be passive insubordination.\u201d On July 28, 2008, Chief Lehner reversed Sgt. Eichhorn\u2019s decision to transfer Hagen because Hagen\u2019s performance evaluations had been strong, and because Hagen had not been notified of any deficiencies in his performance.\nShortly after Chief Lehner rescinded Hagen\u2019s transfer, Sgt. Eichhorn e-mailed Lt. Aguilar a list of concerns about Ha-gen\u2019s job performance. These concerns included Hagen\u2019s failure to maintain training logs, resistence to changes in procedure, high bite ratios, use of force beyond his training, and resistence to working with the SWAT team. Sgt. Eichhorn later acknowledged that after he decided to remove Hagen from the K-9 team, he began writing negatively about events that he had previously regarded positively or neutrally.\nIn late August 2008, Hagen met with Sgt. Eichhorn and Lt. Aguilar to discuss Hagen\u2019s tenure on the K-9 team. They gave Hagen a Performance Expectations memorandum, which included several of the concerns itemized in Sgt. Eichhorn\u2019s earlier list. Then in October 2008, Sgt. Eichhorn and Lt. Bills placed Hagen on a formal Performance Management Plan. The memorandum documenting the Plan noted that \u201csituations and concerns ha[d] arisen with regard to [Hagen\u2019s] job performance\u201d over \u201cthe last several months\u201d and expanded on the performance expectations Sgt. Eichhorn and Lt. Aguilar had outlined for Hagen in August. In a subsequent February 2009 Performance Evaluation, Sgt. Eichhorn rated Hagen\u2019s work significantly lower than he had in the previous two years.\nIn March 2009, Lt. Bills placed the K-9 team on stand-down after she learned from the city\u2019s risk manager that \u201cthe canine officers were not talking to Sergeant Eichhorn about safety problems on the team.\u201d Lt. Bills testified that she believed this lack of communication raised serious liability, safety, and risk issues, and threatened the cohesion and general functioning of the K-9 team. During the stand-down, Lt. Bills investigated these safety and communication concerns by interviewing K-9 officers Hagen, Hubbard, and Rosales, as well as Sgt. Eichhorn. Following the investigation, Lt. Bills determined that \u201ca serious performance issue exist[ed] with the officers that pose[d] a significant risk to team safety\u201d and recommended that officers Hagen, Hubbard, and Rosales be reassigned from the K-9 unit to patrol.\nIn May 2009, after the stand-down and investigation, Lt. Bills reactivated officers Rosales and Hubbard to their K-9 duties, on the condition that they adhere to the chain of command- and follow specified K-9 operations procedures. Lt. Bills decided, however, to transfer Hagen from the K-9 unit. Following her investigation, Lt. Bills presented this decision to then-acting Chief of Police Kerns, who expressed no concerns about Lt. Bills\u2019s decision despite his knowledge that Hagen believed he was being retaliated against for airing his SWAT safety concerns. Lt. Bills later explained that her decision to transfer Ha-gen from the K-9 team was motivated by Hagen\u2019s unwillingness to speak or resolve issues with Sgt. Eichhorn, in contrast to officers Rosales and Hubbard, who were more willing to do anything to work things out with Sgt. Eichhorn. Hagen'had told Lt. Bills during his interview with her, however, that he was \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d to resolve trust and communication issues with Sgt. Eichhorn.\nB\nIn April 2010, Hagen sued the City of Eugene, Chief Kerns, Lt. Bills, and Sgt. Eichhorn under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He alleged that the individual Appellants deprived him of his constitutional rights by retaliating against him for exercising his free-speech rights under the First Amendment. Hagen sought to hold the City of Eugene liable for the individual Appellants\u2019 personnel actions on the theory that Chief Kerns was a final policymaker for the City and had ratified Appellants\u2019 retaliatory conduct on behalf of the City.\nFollowing discovery, Appellants moved for summary judgment on Hagen\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. They argued that (1) Hagen\u2019s speech was not a matter of public concern; (2) Hagen spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen; and (3) Hagen could not show that his allegedly protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind his adverse employment action. In denying the motion for summary judgment, the court concluded that Hagen\u2019s speech \u201cwas a matter of public concern as a matter of law\u201d because \u201caccidental firearms discharges by police officers while in the field are inherently public,\u201d regardless of Ha-gen\u2019s own personal-safety concerns. But the district court also determined that issues of fact remained \u201cregarding the scope and content of plaintiffs job responsibilities,\u201d and thus it was \u201cunable to rule as a matter of law\u201d whether Hagen spoke in his capacity as a private citizen or a public employee.\nThe parties stipulated to have the court decide whether Hagen\u2019s safety complaints involved a matter of public concern. The day after a hearing on that issue, but before the court issued a ruling, Appellants moved \u201cfor judgment in their favor based on qualified immunity on [the] \u2018public concern\u2019 issue,\u201d pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court denied Appellants\u2019 motion, holding that Hagen\u2019s complaints involved a matter of public concern as a matter of law.\nThe district court held a jury trial the following week. At the close of Hagen\u2019s case-in-chief, Appellants moved orally for a JMOL under Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court denied the motion.\nFollowing the close of Appellants\u2019 case and after the court instructed the jury, Appellants renewed their Rule 50(a) motion \u201cfor the same reasons that were raised at the close of plaintiffs case.\u201d The court again denied the motion without comment.\nIn a unanimous general verdict rendered on March 14, 2012, the jury found that Hagen had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that each Appellant \u201chad deprived [him] of his First Amendment Right of Free Speech under the United States Constitution.\u201d The jury awarded Hagen $50,000 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages (Kerns, $50,000; Bills, $50,000; Eichhorn, $100,000). The district court entered judgment in Hagen\u2019s favor on March 28, 2012.\nOn April 19, 2012, Appellants moved for JMOL under Rule 50(b). The district court denied the motion \u201cbased on [its] prior rulings on the record, the evidence received at trial, and the jury verdict.\u201d\nAppellants timely appealed to this Court from the judgment against them and the district court\u2019s order denying their Rule 50(b) motion.\nII\n\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Barnard, v. Theobald, 721 F.3d 1069, 1075 (9th Cir.2013). \u201cJudgment as a matter of law is appropriate when the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, permits only one reasonable conclusion, which is contrary to the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1161 (9th Cir.1997). Conversely, if there is \u201csuch relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to' support [the jury\u2019s] conclusion,\u201d we must affirm the denial of a JMOL motion. Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, 177 F.3d 839, 856 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting Landes Constr. Co. v. Royal Bank of Can., 833 F.2d 1365, 1371 (9th Cir.1987)).\nIII\nAppellants contend that the district court erred in denying their JMOL motion because Hagen failed to establish that he spoke as a private citizen, a necessary element to his First Amendment retaliation claim under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). Specifically, Appellants argue that the undisputed evidence at trial supported the conclusion that Hagen \u201cspoke as part of his public duties as a police officer, not as a private citizen, because he was required by [the] City and police department policy to report safety concerns.\u201d Hagen responds that he was not speaking as a public employee because he \u201cdid not \u2018report\u2019 anything\u201d pursuant to a \u201cjob duty\u201d but rather \u201cdiscussed his concerns\u201d about accidents taking place at work.\nA\nThe First Amendment shields public employees from employment retaliation for their protected speech activities. Garcetti 547 U.S. at 417, 126 S.Ct. 1951. We have explained, however, that our \u201crecognition for \u2018the State\u2019s interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees\u2019 \u201d requires us to \u201c \u2018arrive at a balance between the interests of the [public employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u2019 \u201d Karl v. City of Mountlake Terrace, 678 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir.2012) (quoting Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 140, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)). We strike this balance by asking five questions:\n(1) whether the plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern; (2) whether the plaintiff spoke as a private citizen or public employee; (3) whether the plaintiffs protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action; (4) whether the state had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from other members of the general public; and (5) whether the state would have taken the adverse employment action even absent the protected speech.\nEng v. Cooley, 552 F.3d 1062, 1070 (9th Cir.2009). \u201c[A]ll the factors are necessary, in the sense that failure to meet any one of them is fatal to the plaintiffs case.\u201d Dahlia v. Rodriguez, No. 10-55978, 735 F.3d 1060, 1067, 2013 WL 4437594, at *5 n. 4 (9th Cir. Aug. 21, 2013) (en banc).\nThe dispositive issue here is whether sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Hagen\u2019s speech was protected because he spoke as a private citizen. This is a mixed question of law and fact. Posey v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist. No. 84, 546 F.3d 1121, 1129 (9th Cir.2008). \u201cThe scope and content of a plaintiffs job responsibilities is a question of fact over which we lack jurisdiction, while \u2018the ultimate constitutional significance of the undisputed facts\u2019 is a question of law.\u201d Karl, 678 F.3d at 1071 (alteration omitted) (quoting Eng, 552 F.3d at 1071).\n\u201cA public employee\u2019s speech is not protected by the First Amendment when it is made pursuant to the employee\u2019s official job responsibilities.\u201d Id. (citing Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 426, 126 S.Ct. 1951). Conversely, a public employee\u2019s speech on a matter of public concern is protected \u201cif the speaker \u2018had no official duty\u2019 to make the questioned statements, ... or if the speech was not the product of \u2018performing the tasks the employee was paid to perform.\u2019 \u201d Posey, 546 F.3d at 1127 n. 2 (alteration and some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Marable v. Nitchman, 511 F.3d 924, 933 (9th Cir.2007); Freitag v. Ayers, 468 F.3d 528, 544 (9th Cir.2006)). Statements do not lose First Amendment protection simply because they concern \u201cthe subject matter of [the plaintiffs] employment.\u201d Freitag, 468 F.3d at 545. But \u201cspeech which \u2018owes its existence to an employee\u2019s professional responsibilities\u2019 is not protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Huppert v. City of Pittsburg, 574 F.3d 696, 704 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting Garcetti 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951), overruled on other grounds by Dahlia, 735 F.3d 1060, 2013 WL 4437594.\nGenerally, \u201cin a highly hierarchical employment setting such as law enforcement,\u201d Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1074, 2013 WL 4437594, at *10, \u201c \u2018when a public employee raises complaints or concerns up the chain of command at his workplace about his job duties, that speech is undertaken in the course of performing his job,\u2019 although \u2018it is not dispositive that a public employee\u2019s statements are made internally,\u2019 \u201d id. (citation omitted) (quoting Davis v. McKinney, 518 F.3d 304, 313 & n. 3 (5th Cir.2008)). If, on the other hand, \u201ca public employee takes his job concerns to persons outside the work place in addition to raising them up the chain of command at his workplace, then those external communications are ordinarily not made as an employee, but as a citizen.\u201d Id. (quoting McKinney, 518 F.3d at 313); see also Freitag, 468 F.3d at 545-46 (holding that where a prison official made \u201cinternal reports of inmate sexual misconduct ... the prison\u2019s failure to respond,\u201d she spoke as a \u201cpublic employee,\u201d and that speech thus was thus unprotected, but when she made external reports about the same circumstances to a state senator and the state inspector general, she \u201cacted as a citizen,\u201d and that speech was protected under the First Amendment).\nIn Garcetti, the Supreme Court held that it was \u201cnot dispositive\u201d that an employee \u201cexpressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly,\u201d nor was it dispositive that an employee wrote a memorandum that \u201cconcerned the subject matter of [his] employment.\u201d 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. While it declined to \u201carticulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee\u2019s duties in cases where there is room for serious debate,\u201d the Court emphasized that \u201c[t]he proper inquiry is a practical one\u201d untied to formal job descriptions. Id. at 424-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951; see also Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1074, 2013 WL 4437594, at *10 (acknowledging \u201cthe fact-intensive nature of the inquiry\u201d and the fact that \u201cno single formulation of factors can encompass the full set of inquiries relevant to determining the scope of a plaintiffs job duties\u201d).\nB\nHagen, like the public employee in Garcetti, expressed his concerns about officer safety to coworkers and others within the chain of command at EPD. His speech concerned his employment and safety issues EPD officers were required to report as part of the \u201ctasks [they were] paid to perform.\u201d Ellins, 710 F.3d at 1058. As a K-9 officer, Hagen worked in a \u201chighly hierarchical employment setting.\u201d Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1074, 2013 WL 4437594, at *10. The evidence establishes that his concerns were directed to his coworkers and his superior officers.\nWhere an \u201cemployee prepares a routine report, pursuant to normal departmental procedure about a particular incident or occurrence, the employee\u2019s preparation of that report is typically within his job duties.\u201d Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1075, 2013 WL 4437594, at *10 (citation omitted). Conversely, complaints regarding \u201cbroad concerns about corruption or systemic abuse\u201d are unlikely to \u201cbe classified as being within the job duties of an average public employee.\u201d Id. All of Hagen\u2019s complaints involved safety concerns stemming from \u201cparticular incidents] or occurrence[s],\u201d Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1075, 2013 WL 4437594, at *10, and the City of Eugene\u2019s Human Resource and Risk Services Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual required him to report safety concerns. The Manual provides that \u201cEmployees are ... responsible for reporting accidents, faulty equipment, unsafe practices of fellow employees, and/or unsafe conditions of work areas to their supervisors.\u201d In addition, a EPD General Order provides that employees should \u201c[r]eport any safety hazard or malfunctioning equipment to [their] supervisor immediately so that corrective action can be taken.\u201d\nNotwithstanding his duty under this policy, Hagen argues that he did not actually \u201creport\u201d anything \u201cas that term is used, understood and applied\u201d in Garcetti because he was \u201crepeatedly bringing up well-known information.\u201d He' maintains that Garcetti and other cases involving reports to supervisors \u201chave no relevance to a situation where, instead of reporting information, plaintiff was repeatedly discussing a known, dangerous situation until his supervisors eventually became exasperated.\u201d This Court rejected a similar contention in Dahlia: \u201cThat [plaintiffs supervisor] appears to have ignored [plaintiffs] initial report does not convert into protected speech [plaintiffs] later reports to the same supervisor.\u201d Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1076, 2013 WL 4437594, at *12. Thus, the repetitive nature of Hagen\u2019s complaints did not convert them into private speech.\nHagen contends that Marable v. Nitch-man, 511 F.3d 924 (9th Cir.2007), places his safety complaints outside of his official duties. We disagree. In Marable, a ship engineer complained of 'Corruption by the manager of the Washington State Ferries. Id. at 927. This Court held that Garcetti was inapplicable because it was not part of a ship engineer\u2019s assigned duties to complain about corrupt conduct of his supervisors. Id. at 933. \u201cFunctionally,\u201d we explained, \u201cit cannot be disputed that [Marable\u2019s] job was to do the tasks of a Chief Engineer on his ferry, and such tasks did not include pointing to corrupt actions of higher level officials.\u201d Id. at 932\nHere, in contrast, Hagen\u2019s concerns about SWAT safety were inextricably intertwined with his duties as a K-9 officer. Hagen\u2019s concerns \u2014 that the EPD SWAT team with which he often deployed was poorly trained and therefore risked officer and public safety \u2014 contain all the hallmarks of traditionally internal work-place complaints one would typically expect an officer to communicate to his superiors, even absent a formal written duty to do so.\nThat Hagen raised his concerns about his and his fellow officers\u2019 job safety internally and within the chain of command cements our conclusion that his comments were made as a public employee, and not as a private citizen. Compare Dahlia, 735 F.3d at 1073-75, 2013 WL 4437594, at *10; id. at 1076-77, 2013 WL 4437594, at *12 (\u201cEven construing the facts and drawing all inferences in Dahlia\u2019s favor, the only reasonable conclusion is that Dahlia acted pursuant to his job duties when he ... reported up the chain of command to the supervising lieutenant overseeing the investigation about abuse related to the same investigation.\u201d), with Andrew v. Clark, 561 F.3d 261, 266-67 (4th Cir.2009) (finding that whether an officer\u2019s memorandum regarding the shooting death of \u00e1 suspect \u201cwas written as part of [the officer\u2019s] official duties was a disputed issue of material fact that cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\u201d in part because the officer leaked the memorandum to the Baltimore Sun).\nThe district court instructed the jury that for Hagen to prove that Appellants deprived him of his First Amendment right, he had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he \u201cspoke as a citizen and not as part of his official duties.\u201d Implicit in the jury\u2019s general verdict in his favor, therefore, is its finding that Hagen did not air his safety concerns as a part of his official duties. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ha-gen, however, \u201cpermits only one reasonable conclusion,\u201d Omega, 127 F.3d at 1161, which is that as a factual and a practical matter, Hagen made his repeated internal complaints about departmental safety and officer competency only in his official capacity as an EPD officer. Hagen therefore has not established a constitutional violation.\nConclusion\nWe conclude that, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ha-gen, insufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that Hagen spoke as a private citizen. Hagen had an official duty to report his safety concerns and thus spoke as a public employee when he repeatedly complained within the chain of command about work-related safety issues. Because this conclusion is contrary to the jury\u2019s verdict, each Appellant was entitled to JMOL.\nWe therefore REVERSE and REMAND with instructions that the district court vacate its judgment in Hagen\u2019s favor and enter judgment in favor of Appellants on each of Hagen\u2019s claims.\n. Defendant Pete Kerns became acting Chief of Police on October 17, 2008, and continued in that position until officially appointed Chief of Police on August 28, 2009.\n. In conjunction with their JMOL motion following the jury verdict, Appellants simultaneously moved for a new trial under Rule 59(a)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They argued that the district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of a grievance arbitration proceeding prejudiced aspects of their defense. Appellants do not pursue this argument on appeal.\n. Hagen has not argued that he acted as a private person in reporting his safely concerns to police union officials, nor has he presented any evidence regarding the police union's agreement with EPD concerning employee grievances.",
