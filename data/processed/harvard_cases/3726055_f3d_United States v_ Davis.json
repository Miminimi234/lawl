        "text": "RILEY, Chief Judge.\nThis case is before us on remand from the United States Supreme Court. On August 22, 2012, our court affirmed Milo Vareen Davis\u2019s convictions and sentences for conspiring to distribute cocaine base and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), 846, and 851, and for money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)\u00a9 and 2. See United States v. Davis, 690 F.3d 912, 917-18, 929 (8th Cir.2012). In affirming Davis\u2019s sentence, we concluded any error the district court made in failing to apply retroactively the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, was harmless given the basis for Davis\u2019s sentence. See Davis, 690 F.3d at 928-29 (discussing Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (holding \u201cthe new, more lenient mandatory minimum provisions\u201d of the FSA apply to pre-FSA offenders)).\nDavis filed a petition for writ of certiora-ri. On June 24, 2013, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). See Davis v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2852, 186 L.Ed.2d 903 (2013). In Alleyne, the Supreme Court held the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that increases a mandatory minimum sentence. See Alleyne, 570 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2162-63.\nHaving reconsidered Davis\u2019s appeal as directed by the Supreme Court, we again affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and reinstate all but Part II.F. of our prior opinion. See Davis, 690 F.3d at 928-29. Any errors the district court committed with respect to Davis\u2019s sentence are harmless under the circumstances of this case. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d)-\nA jury convicted Davis of conspiring to distribute drugs and of money laundering. Specifically, the jury determined Davis conspired to distribute \u201c50 grams or more of cocaine base\u201d , and \u201c500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine,\u201d in each case the maximum amount specified on the verdict form. Based on the jury\u2019s quantity findings, the district court \u2014 though consistent with the law at the time \u2014 erroneously advised Davis at sentencing that he was subject to a mandatory minimum of twenty years imprisonment. , -\nNotwithstanding Davis\u2019s argument to the contrary, the district court\u2019s error did not affect Davis\u2019s substantial rights. In calculating Davis\u2019s advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) range, ,\n[t]he district court found Davis responsible for 5,163.06 grams of crack and 3,649.15 grams of powder cocaine, which resulted in an adjusted offense level of 36. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Because the adjusted offense level of 40 for the money laundering conviction was higher, the district court applied that level to both counts, determining Davis was subject to an advisory Guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment for his conspiracy conviction (level 40, category IV). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3(a) (explaining the offense level that applies to a group of closely related offenses is \u201cthe highest offense level of the counts in the [gjroup\u201d).\nDavis, 690 F.3d at 928-29. Closely analyzing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the district court found \u201ca basis to go ... above the low end of the advisory guideline range of 360 months\u201d to life but \u201cdecline[d] to do so\u201d and concluded a 360-month sentence was \u201csupported by the evidence[ ] and ... sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing\u201d regardless of the application of the FSA. Davis\u2019s sentence was not based on the twenty-year mandatory minimum.\nBecause any Alleyne error in this case is harmless, we affirm.\n. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.\n. The FSA increased the threshold quantities of cocaine base necessary to trigger statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). See FSA \u00a7 2.\n. The government concedes \"[ujnder the FSA and post-Dorsey, the jury's [drug-quantity] finding places [Davis] under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) for a statutory range of 10 years\u2019 to life imprisonment.\u201d\n. Our observation in Davis that \" 'a district court may impose a sentence based on a drug quantity determination greater than that found by the jury so long as the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum of the convicted offense and the district court's calculation is supported by sufficient evidenced \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 even where the district court\u2019s finding subjects a defendant to a lengthier mandatory minimum sentence than that which would be applicable based solely on the jury's quantity determination,'\" Davis, 690 F.3d at 928 (quoting United States v. Webb, 545 F.3d 673, 677 (8th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted)), is no longer correct according to Al-leyne, 570 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2155.\n.The government questions whether Davis \"failed to preserve an objection, thereby forfeiting his Alleyne claim\u201d and subjecting his claim to plain-error review under Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). We need not address that issue in this appeal. See United States v. Anderson, 236 F.3d 427, 429 n. 3 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (\"Because we conclude that the ... error does not warrant reversal under harmless-error analysis, we need not decide whether the more stringent plain-error standard of review would apply to this case.\u201d).",
