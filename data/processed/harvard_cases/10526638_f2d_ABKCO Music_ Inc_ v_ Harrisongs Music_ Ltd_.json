        "text": "CARDAMONE, Circuit Judge:\nBright Tunes Music Corporation (Bright Tunes) held the copyright to a song entitled \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d (HSF) composed by Ronald Mack. George Harrison, a former member of the musical group \u201cThe Beatles,\u201d had authored a song called \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d (MSL). In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison claiming that his song infringed the copyright of Mack\u2019s song. A trial court in 1976 agreed. Today, over 15 years later, the damages issue flowing from this infringement is still being litigated, giving true-meaning for those involved to the title of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s Been a Hard Day\u2019s Night.\u201d Subsequent to the determinations to be made on the remand hereby directed, we fully expect the curtain to fall on this long-playing litigation.\nBACKGROUND\nThe events leading up to this appeal are more fully set forth in the four prior opinions in this case, Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 420 F.Supp. 177 (S.D.N.Y.1976); ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 508 F.Supp. 798 (S.D.N.Y.1981), aff'd with modification and remanded, 722 F.2d 988 (2d Cir.1983); and ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 841 F.2d 494 (2d Cir.1988) (per curiam), familiarity with which is assumed. We recount only those facts needed to resolve this appeal.\nIn 1971 when Bright Tunes brought its copyright infringement suit against Harrisongs Music Ltd., Harrisongs Music, Inc. and George Harrison (Harrison Interests or Harrison), ABKCO Music, Inc. and its president and \u201cmoving spirit,\u201d Allen B. Klein, served as business manager for the Beatles and handled Harrison's business affairs. In an attempt to end the Bright Tunes\u2019 litigation Klein, acting for Harrison, offered to buy out Bright Tunes, the property of which consisted mainly of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d copyright and the lawsuit against the Harrison Interests. Negotiations continued slowly over several years.\nIn the meantime Klein and the Beatles had a falling out, ending their relationship and resulting in bitter litigation. In late 1975 and early 1976, the Harrison Interests and Bright Tunes renewed settlement negotiations and the Harrison Interests made an offer that counsel for Bright Tunes considered to be a good one. But Klein, without Harrison\u2019s knowledge, made an offer to buy Bright Tunes for an amount almost double that offered by the Harrison Interests. Bright Tunes, reasoning that Klein\u2019s offer likely indicated an accurate view of the value of the lawsuit because of his inside knowledge of the Harrison Interests\u2019 business affairs, thereupon declined Harrison\u2019s lower offer. Klein\u2019s offer was also rejected, and the case then went to trial. Following a three-day bench trial in 1976, Judge Owen ruled in favor of Bright Tunes, finding that Harrison subconsciously plagiarized HSF, but reserved judgment on the issue of damages. 420 F.Supp. at 177. Klein\u2019s successful efforts to booby-trap the settlement negotiations is critical to an understanding of this lengthy litigation, and was a significant factor in the direction subsequent court opinions have taken.\nThe damages issue was not decided until 1981, in the meanwhile certain events in 1977, 1978 and 1980 should be recited. In June 1977 an infringement action in England by Peter Maurice Music Co., Ltd. (Maurice) \u2014 the subpublisher of \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d in all places other than the United States and Canada \u2014 against the Harrison Interests was settled with the Harrison Interests agreeing to pay Maurice 40 percent of the past and future monies received through exploitation of the \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d copyright in the United Kingdom and retaining 60 percent of those revenues (the UK settlement). The parties also agreed to use \u201ctheir best endeavours\u201d to secure similar settlements throughout the remainder of Maurice\u2019s territory. Maurice had obtained its interest in \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d under a licensing agreement entered into in 1963 between it and Bright Tunes. Under the agreement, Maurice was obligated to pay Bright Tunes 50 percent of all amounts received from HSF, less sheet music royalties \u2014 in exchange for the right to exploit that song worldwide, save for the United States and Canada.\nOn April 13, 1978 ABKCO purchased all of Bright Tunes\u2019 interest in \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine,\u201d including the right to certain royalties and all rights assertable against infringing compositions for $587,000 (the 1978 acquisition). ABKCO adopted Bright Tunes\u2019 complaint and was substituted as the sole party plaintiff in the action against the Harrison Interests. Harrison asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaims against ABKCO and Klein for breaches of fiduciary duty relating to the purchase of the Bright Tunes\u2019 properties. The district court held an eight-day bench trial on damages and counterclaims between August and October 1979.\nFinally, on April 2, 1980 Harrison and Essex Music International, Ltd. (Essex), Harrison\u2019s agent and a sub-publisher of \u201cMy Sweet Lord,\u201d entered into an agreement authorizing Essex to negotiate and enter into settlement agreements on the same terms as the UK settlement, that is, Harrison paying 40 percent (and retaining 60 percent) of MSL revenues to any parties owning interests in \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d everywhere, except the U.S., the U.K. and Canada. The next day Essex and ABKCO entered into an agreement by which they agreed to settle these \u201cforeign claims\u201d and Essex paid ABKCO a $600,000 non-returnable advance to be recouped through a pooling of their respective interests in the royalties from both songs. The agreement also provided that when Essex recouped the $600,000, the parties would pool their interests in earnings flowing from both songs, with ABKCO assigning to Essex 50 percent of its share of them and Essex assigning 50 percent of its interest in \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d to ABKCO. Throughout the rest of 1980, the foreign claims were settled on the same 60/40 percent basis used in the UK settlement (the 1980 settlements).\nThe district court resolved the damages issue on February 19, 1981 holding that the Harrison Interests owed $1,599,987 to ABKCO but, as ABKCO had breached its fiduciary duty to Harrison between 1975 and 1978, it was not entitled to profit from its purchase of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d rights from Bright Tunes and therefore could not collect that amount. 508 F.Supp. 798. Specifically, the district court found that ABKCO\u2019s \u201ccovert intrusion\u201d into the settlement negotiations between the Harrison and Bright Tunes \u201cirreparably destroyed the ability\u201d of the Harrison Interests to settle the case for an amount comparable to their settlement offer, which was in a range already deemed to be good by Bright Tunes\u2019 counsel. The trial court ordered ABKCO to hold the fruits of the 1978 acquisition in a constructive trust for the benefit of the Harrison Interests, to be transferred to them upon their payment to ABKCO of $587,000 (ABKCO\u2019s purchase price for Bright Tunes) plus interest (the 1982 judgment). Id. at 803.\nOn appeal, we affirmed the finding of a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by Klein to Harrison, but ruled that because the foreign infringement claims were voluntarily settled in 1980, the trust should not include that portion of ABKCO\u2019s acquisition constituting a purchase of the foreign rights that had been so settled. 722 F.2d 988. Thus, the case was remanded to the district court \u201cto determine what portion of the $587,000 paid by ABKCO to Bright Tunes is attributable to the foreign rights involved in the April 3, 1980 settlement.\u201d 722 F.2d at 997. The district court was instructed to subtract that amount from the $587,000 to determine how much the Harrison interests were to pay to ABKCO to recover the rights not affected by the settlement.\nOn remand the district court found $316,-980 of the $587,000 ABKCO paid Bright Tunes was attributable to the foreign rights and, Harrison thus had to pay $270,-020 to Klein to obtain the remainder of the rights in the constructive trust (the 1986 judgment). In making this determination, the trial court interpreted its task as requiring it to put itself in the position of ABKCO at the time of the purchase to determine how it allocated its purchase price. To make the computation, it relied on Klein\u2019s testimony that he thought \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d had earned about $1,500,000 worldwide, of which approximately $550,-000 were United States revenues and $950,-000 were foreign revenues. The district court then used records Klein supplied indicating that approximately 15 percent of the non-United States revenues were earned in the United Kingdom and should thus be subtracted from the total foreign revenues. Based on these calculations, the district court concluded that Klein attributed 54 percent of the total \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d revenues to the foreign rights. This percentage was used by the trial court to arrive at its determination that Harrison owed ABKCO $270,020 plus interest (46 percent of $587,000) for the rights not affected by the 1980 settlements.\nBoth parties again appealed. This time we found there was no final decision to take an appeal from because the district court had not decided \u201cwhich portion of the fruits of the constructive trust were affected by the 1980 Settlement.\u201d 841 F.2d 494. Hence, the case was once again remanded for such finding.\nOn remand the district court found the fruits of the constructive trust did not include:\n(i) \u201cHe's So Fine\u201d copyrights for and revenues from all territories of the world, except the U.S., U.K., and Canada (foreign territories);\n(ii) an administrative fee of 20 percent on the gross revenues of both songs ABKCO must transfer to the Harrison Interests pursuant to the judgment;\n(iii) the $600,000 payment to ABKCO from Essex;\n(iv) the rights obtained in the 1980 settlements and the 1978 acquisition relating to the foreign territories.\nThus, these items were not fruits of the constructive trust affected by the 1980 settlements and were to remain with ABKCO. The trial court further found that the fruits of the constructive trust, not affected by the 1980 settlements, include:\n(i) rights to \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d in the U.S., U.K., and Canada;\n(ii) gross revenues received by ABKCO from exploiting that song in the U.S., U.K., and Canada or derived from the rights and agreements to be transferred such as the revenues received by ABKCO from the 1977 UK settlement less writer\u2019s royalties paid by ABKCO and ABKCO\u2019s 20 percent administration fee.\nThese items were to be transferred to the Harrison Interests. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.\nDISCUSSION\nNeither party is thoroughly satisfied with the district court\u2019s decision. In its appeal ABKCO contends the district court incorrectly valued its interest in the 1980 settlements, thereby diminishing the payment due it from the Harrison Interests. The Harrison Interests cross-appeal arguing that the district court should not have allowed ABKCO to receive a fee for its management of the constructive trust or to retain its interest in the copyright of \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d in the fora covered by the 1980 settlements. The Harrison Interests also urge that the $600,000 ABKCO received as part of an agreement to settle foreign infringement claims should serve to remove the requirement that they pay ABKCO any money.\nOur task is limited to reviewing the district court\u2019s determination of which of the items held in constructive trust by ABKCO were affected by the agreements entered into in 1980 to settle infringement suits in various countries around the world and what the value of those items is. We turn first to ABKCO\u2019s appeal.\nI The ABKCO Appeal\nABKCO contends that in computing the amount it had attributed to \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u2019s\u201d foreign revenues when purchasing the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d rights, the district court made two errors. Were those errors corrected, ABKCO continues, it would diminish the amount attributable to \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d foreign revenues, thereby increasing the amount the Harrison Interests must pay ABKCO to retrieve the fruits of the constructive trust not affected by the 1980 settlements.\nA.\nThe first error, ABKCO contends, is in attributing the entire gross foreign revenues of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d to ABKCO\u2019s purchase price for \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine.\u201d Instead, appellant believes the district court should only have attributed 20 percent of those revenues to the purchase price. ABKCO asserts that in 1978 it knew the Harrison Interests and Maurice had agreed to use their \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to settle the foreign claims on a 60/40 percent basis, and that the rights it purchased from Bright Tunes amounted to only 50 percent of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d foreign revenues received by Maurice due to the Bright Tunes-Maurice licensing agreement. To put it in other words, Maurice was entitled to 40 percent of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d foreign revenues, only half of which belonged to Bright Tunes, whose interests ABKCO purchased. Thus, ABKCO concludes, it knew it was only entitled to 20 percent (one-half of 40 percent) of the gross \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d foreign revenues when it purchased Bright Tunes\u2019 interests. Therefore, ABKCO asserts the district court erred in attributing 100 percent of the foreign revenues to the $587,000 purchase price. Instead, ABKCO contends \u2014 all other factors remaining as the trial court computed them \u2014 only $127,966 of the $587,000 should be attributed to the foreign rights and the Harrison interests should have to pay the remaining $459,034 to ABKCO, rather than $270,020 that the trial court found.\nTo this argument Harrison makes two responses: first, ABKCO did not make any allocations at the time of its 1978 acquisition from Bright Tunes and, most importantly, did not believe itself bound by either the UK settlement or the Bright Tunes-Maurice licensing agreement; second, and an alternative basis for the district court\u2019s attribution of 100 percent of the foreign revenues to the purchase price, was that ABKCO was not entitled to 100 percent of the gross \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d domestic revenues since some of that song\u2019s success was due to factors other than the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d plagiarizing.\nIn reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact, we will not overturn such findings unless we think they are clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U.S. 214, 223, 108 S.Ct. 1771, 1777, 100 L.Ed.2d 249 (1988). A trial court\u2019s credibility assessments and its determination as to the inferences to be drawn from the record are entitled to considerable deference. See Puritan Ins. Co. v. Eagle S.S. Co. S.A., 779 F.2d 866, 871 (2d Cir.1985). When its view of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record\u2014or if it makes a choice between two permissible views of the evidence\u2014we will not substitute our judgment for the trial court\u2019s even were we to have weighed the evidence differently had we been sitting as the trier of fact. See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).\nExamined in this light the district court\u2019s attribution of 100 percent of the foreign revenues to ABKCO\u2019s purchase price was not clearly erroneous. It was faced with the difficult task of putting itself in ABKCO\u2019s shoes at the time of the 1978 acquisition to ascertain how ABKCO valued each component of the purchase. This difficulty was exacerbated by Klein\u2019s admission that, at the time of the purchase, he actually made no allocations for the various components of Bright Tunes\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d rights.\nAn examination of the evidence reveals the district court\u2019s conclusion was entirely plausible. Klein testified he was aware of the Bright Tunes-Maurice licensing agreement and the UK settlement when he purchased Bright Tunes\u2019 interests in \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine,\u201d but, as noted, made no evaluations of the various components he purchased. Of even greater importance is the fact that Klein clearly did not believe himself bound by those agreements. The contract under which ABKCO purchased the rights to \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d explicitly stated that ABKCO did not consent to the UK judgment\u2014to which neither Bright Tunes nor ABKCO was a party\u2014and that ABKCO believed it was purchasing the sole right to control and conduct all the song\u2019s infringement claims throughout the world. Thus, ABKCO seemed to believe it was not required to settle the foreign claims on a 60/40 percent basis. The UK settlement only required the parties to use their \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to reach that percentage in the settlements; it did not bind them to those percentages. As to the 1963 licensing agreement Maurice had with Bright Tunes, Klein testified he believed at the time of the 1978 acquisition that his rights were superior to those of Maurice, severely undermining his present percentage argument on appeal.\nJudge Owen was also entitled to disbelieve Klein\u2019s statement that he was entitled to 100 percent of the \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d domestic revenues, and decide instead that ABKCO realized it would probably have to share that song\u2019s domestic revenues with the Harrison Interests, because the damages court might well decide that some of the success of the tune was due to Harrison\u2019s name and the lyrics, and not just the copied material. In fact that is precisely what the district court in this case actually found. See 508 F.Supp. at 801-02. While in 1978 ABKCO may not have believed it could completely avoid the UK settlement\u2019s \u201cbest endeavours\u201d clause or undo the Bright Tunes-Maurice licensing agreement and thus be entitled to 100 percent of the \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d foreign revenues, the district court could properly have found that, in its mind at that time, ABKCO offset whatever potential foreign revenues shortfall it foresaw with a comparable shortfall in domestic revenues. By using gross revenues on both sides of the formula\u2014foreign and domestic\u2014the proportion Judge Owen developed remains accurate. Consequently, we see no reason to fault the trial court\u2019s factual finding that in 1978 ABKCO attributed 100 percent of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d gross foreign revenues to the purchase price of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d rights it obtained from Bright Tunes.\nB.\nABKCO\u2019s second challenge to the computations focuses on the \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d revenues attributed to the U.K. which, according to the formula arrived at by the district court for determining which revenues were affected by the 1980 settlements, were deducted from all that tune\u2019s revenues earned outside the U.S. and Canada. The district judge relied on records compiled in 1985 to determine that 15 percent of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u2019s\u201d revenues earned outside the U.S. and Canada were from the U.K. It then decreased the foreign revenues by this percentage to arrive at its final figure for the song\u2019s revenues affected by the 1980 agreements.\nABKCO contends this was error. Specifically, it asserts that if the district court\u2019s objective was to put itself in ABKCO\u2019s position at the time of the 1978 purchase, it should not have used the 15 percent figure because it arose from information collected in 1985 and thus was not available to ABKCO in 1978. Instead, ABKCO continues, a 25 percent figure supplied by a managing director of Maurice, contained in a letter and sales records \u2014 copies of which Klein received in 1976 \u2014 should have been used. The Harrison Interests counter that the finding was not clearly erroneous because the letter itself indicated that the figures were probably incomplete and possibly inaccurate, ABKCO had other sources from which to determine \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u2019s\u201d revenues, and Klein admittedly did not allocate on the basis of the letter.\nWe are satisfied by our review of the evidence that this finding was not clearly erroneous and that 15 percent was appropriate in determining \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u2019s\u201d revenues from the U.K. As Judge Owen noted, Klein was an astute businessman with several sources of information on which to base his analysis. It is a critical fact that the letter accompanying the figures on which Klein on appeal says he relied states that the figures are incomplete and possibly incorrect. It is unlikely Klein would have relied solely on such information, and the district court was entitled to reject Klein\u2019s assertion that the letter was the only information available to him at the time of the purchase. The trial judge was also entitled to conclude that Klein would likely have an accurate analysis of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d sales figures throughout the world. Thus, computing the song\u2019s revenues from the U.K. as 15 percent of all foreign revenues was entirely proper, and not clearly erroneous. Such conclusions lead to an affirmance as to ABKCO\u2019s appeal.\nII The Harrison Interests\u2019 Cross-Appeal\nThe Harrison Interests raise several issues in their cross-appeal. They contend the district court should not have allowed ABKCO to receive a 20 percent management fee for its stewardship of the constructive trust assets and should not have permitted ABKCO to retain the foreign \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d copyrights and revenues. They also contend that the money paid to ABKCO as part of its agreement with Essex to settle the foreign claims should either serve to eliminate the requirement that they pay any money to ABKCO, because such payment would be duplicative, or that it should be turned over to the Harrison Interests as a fruit of the constructive trust not affected by the foreign settlements. Finally, the Harrison interests urge that we return the scope of the constructive trust to its original size because of new evidence of further wrongdoing by Klein and ABKCO. We address each of these contentions in turn.\nA.\nIn the trial proceedings, ABKCO sought to deduct a 20 percent administrative fee from the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d revenues it was required to turn over to the Harrison Interests. The trial court determined the fee covered the cost of producing those revenues, was not a fruit of the 1980 settlement, was a reasonable figure though inexact, and that taking such a fee was industry practice. Based on these findings, ABKCO was allowed to retain 20 percent of the gross revenues of \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d that it would otherwise have been required to turn over to the Harrison Interests. The Harrison Interests argue that the fee is barred by our 1983 judgment, and not supportable either factually or legally. We agree.\nWe think finding the 20 percent fee reasonable was clearly erroneous, and the allowance of it improper. The only factual support for it is Klein\u2019s statement that it is a customary fee that he ordinarily charges. There is no proof that ABKCO incurred any actual expenses or hired additional personnel for the services it rendered. Having failed to prove the expenses it seeks to deduct, it is not entitled to the deduction as a matter of fact. More critical is that, under our prior opinions in this matter, all the fruits of Klein\u2019s acquisition of \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d are required to be turned over, unless they are affected by the foreign settlements. The arbitrary 20 percent charge on monies ABKCO has to disgorge to Harrison has no connection to those settlements. Klein, it must be remembered, had been found earlier to have breached his fiduciary duties and could not suppose, in light of the trust obligation imposed on him, that he could conduct business as usual. Therefore, ABKCO is not entitled to any administrative fee, and the district court's decision to grant that fee was also an error of law.\nB.\nThe Harrison Interests next contend the finding that ABKCO\u2019s ownership of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d copyright and revenues was a necessary predicate to the 1980 settlements and the district court\u2019s conclusion that they were fruits of the 1978 acquisition affected by those settlements were incorrect. Instead, cross-appellants argue that the foreign settlements affected \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d and not \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d revenues, and that the only predicate to ABKCO\u2019s participation in the 1980 settlements was its ownership of the foreign infringement claims \u2014 the only other element affected by the foreign settlements\u2014 and not its ownership of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d copyrights and revenues, which should be turned over to it. Resolution of this issue requires us to determine whether it was ABKCO\u2019s possession of HSF\u2019s copyrights and revenues that was involved in the 1980 settlements or merely its ownership of the infringement claims; we think it was the latter.\nThe legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled to bring actions for infringements of that right occurring during the period of its ownership. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(b). Thus, a copyright owner can assign its copyright but, if the accrued causes of action are not expressly included in the assignment, the assignee will not be able to prosecute them. See Skor-Mor Prod., Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 1982 Copyright Law Decisions (CCH) \u00b6 25,397 at p. 17,298, 1982 WL 1264 (S.D.N.Y.1982); 3 M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright, \u00a7 12-02, at 12-30 (1990) (Nimmer). Rather, the assignee is only entitled to bring actions for infringements that were committed while it was the copyright owner and the assignor retains the right to bring actions accruing during its ownership of the right, even if the actions are brought subsequent to the assignment. Nimmer, \u00a7 12.02 at 12-29-12-30. Finally, the Copyright Act does not permit copyright holders to choose third parties to bring suits on their behalf. See Eden Toys, Inc. v. Floretee Undergarment Co., 697 F.2d 27, 32 n. 3 (2d Cir.1982).\nABKCO apparently recognized this divisibility of rights, see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d)(2), by purchasing from Bright Tunes not only the song\u2019s copyright and the U.S. infringement claim, but also \u201cany and all rights assertable under copyright against the Infringing Composition in any part of the world which may have heretofore arisen or which may hereafter arise\u201d as well as the right to control such claims and collect the settlements. By the same token, ABKCO\u2019s purchase of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d copyright gave it the right to sue for infringements occurring after the transaction. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(b); Nimmer, \u00a7 12.02 at 12-29.\nEach of the 1980 settlement agreements contemplate that the infringements were committed on October 1, 1970 as each awards the song\u2019s interests 40 percent of all \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u2019s\u201d revenues from that date forward. Hence, the claims had already accrued when ABKCO purchased all of Bright Tunes\u2019 rights in \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine.\u201d As a consequence, ABKCO\u2019s right to bring the claims arises not out of its ownership of the copyright, but from its ownership of the claims themselves which it purchased, along with the copyright, in 1978. We therefore conclude that ABKCO\u2019s ownership of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d copyrights was not a necessary predicate to its participation in the 1980 settlements. ABKCO could participate in the 1980 settlements because it owned the infringement claims accrued in 1970, not because it owned the copyright. Thus, ABKCO\u2019s ownership of the copyright was not affected by the 1980 settlements, and ABKCO must surrender the copyright to the Harrison Interests upon proper payment.\nThe district court, in addition, incorrectly permitted ABKCO to retain \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d revenues from the foreign territories. As we have determined that ABKCO may not retain the song\u2019s copyright in these territories, it would be incongruous for it to be entitled to earnings from that source. Ruling that ABKCO is not entitled to these revenues would not undo the 1980 settlements. What ABKCO received from those settlements was the right to a portion of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d revenues. We do not disturb this right by causing ABKCO to surrender its interest in \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d revenues from the foreign territories and conclude ABKCO must do so.\nC.\nThe Harrison Interests further contend the finding that the $600,000 payment ABKCO received pursuant to its April 1980 agreement with Essex was within the 1980 foreign settlements was clearly erroneous and this payment should be disgorged by ABKCO or, alternatively, that the payment was reimbursement for ABKCO\u2019s purchase of the \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d rights from Bright Tunes and therefore cross-appellants should not be required to provide ABKCO with duplicative payment for that purchase.\nWe address first the challenge to the finding that the $600,000 payment was \u201cso closely intertwined with the settlement as to appear reasonably within it.\u201d Again, it must be decided whether and, if so, to what extent the $600,000 payment was a fruit of the constructive trust affected by the 1980 settlements to determine whether ABKCO should have to turn any of it over to the Harrison interests. Pursuant to its agreement with Essex, ABKCO received a $600,-000 payment that Essex could recoup from its own share of \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d revenues and ABKCO\u2019s share of the two tunes\u2019 revenues.\nSince ABKCO\u2019s entitlement to \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d revenues arose from the 1980 settlements, clearly the portion of Essex\u2019s payment attributable to those revenues was closely intertwined with the settlements and in this aspect the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. With respect to the portion of the payment attributable to ABKCO\u2019s assignment of \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d revenues, the trial court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. ABKCO\u2019s right to that song\u2019s revenues arose separate and apart from the 1980 settlements and, as we stated earlier, was not a right affected by those settlements. Since ABKCO may not receive the revenues flowing from exploitation of the song directly, it follows that it may not receive any payment made in exchange for its rights to those revenues. Consequently, we must remand to the district court for it to determine what portion of the $600,000 payment was made in exchange for ABKCO\u2019s \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d revenues and cause ABKCO to disgorge that amount to the Harrison interests.\nContrary to the Harrison Interests\u2019 alternative contention, ABKCO gave up something valuable \u2014 its right to revenues from both songs \u2014 in exchange for the $600,000 payment. The payment was thus not merely reimbursement for ABKCO\u2019s 1978 acquisition but consideration given in exchange for a valuable asset. ABKCO\u2019s May 1980 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, in which it stated it had recovered its cost of acquiring \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine\u201d through various worldwide agreements, does not persuade us to the contrary. It is entirely plausible to construe ABKCO\u2019s statement merely as recognition of the fact that the settlement agreements it entered into and the payment it received in exchange for its surrender of rights to the songs\u2019 revenues were sufficient to recover the cost of the 1978 acquisition and not as an admission that the $600,000 payment was reimbursement to ABKCO for its purchase price of \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine.\u201d The Harrison Interests\u2019 contention that the payment constituted reimbursement for the purchase price of that song is not persuasive. We decline to grant its request to eliminate, on that basis, the requirement that they must pay ABKCO to recover the fruits of the constructive trust not affected by the 1980 settlement.\nD.\nHarrison\u2019s final arguments arise out of allegedly newly discovered evidence of \u201ccovert\u201d involvement by ABKCO in negotiations between the Harrison Interests and Essex, Harrison\u2019s agent. Specifically, cross-appellants urge that had they known that ABKCO and Essex negotiated and entered into the agreement by which Essex paid ABKCO $600,000 in return for certain rights to both songs, while the Harrison Interests negotiated with Essex regarding their agreement to allow Essex to settle the foreign claims, they would not have given Essex consent to settle the foreign claims. Thus, cross-appellants continue, when the case was before us previously we erroneously relied on a policy of upholding the settlement of claims to modify and limit the scope of the constructive trust because they did not enter into the settlement agreements voluntarily due to their lack of knowledge of ABKCO\u2019s involvement, and the subject matter of the 1980 settlements should be placed into the constructive trust. The Harrison Interests also argue that we should impose sanctions on ABKCO \u2014 such as removing the requirement that cross-appellants pay money to ABKCO \u2014 as a result of its alleged misconduct.\nThere is nothing in this contention that causes us to change either the scope of the constructive trust or to sanction ABKCO. When we modified the scope of the constructive trust, see 722 F.2d at 997, the Harrison Interests had access to the ABKCO-Essex agreement and the agreement was included in the record on appeal. It must have been clear to anyone examining the agreement that ABKCO negotiated with Essex while Harrison was negotiating the agreement enabling Essex to settle the foreign claims \u2014 the ABKCO-Essex agreement was executed one day after the Harrison-Essex agreement \u2014 and it would be unreasonable to believe it was negotiated and drafted in that short period of time. With this knowledge, we held that the 1980 settlement agreements \u2014 made on the precise terms sought by the Harrison Interests \u2014 were entered into voluntarily. We agree with the district court that the evidence now adduced by Harrison is insufficient to reopen the proceedings.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court insofar as ABKCO\u2019s appeal is concerned is affirmed; the Harrison Interests\u2019 cross-appeal is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the district court for it to further proceed consistent with this opinion.",

In making this allocation, the district court was effectuating an instruction by this court \u201cto determine what portion of the $587,000 paid by ABKCO to Bright Tunes is attributable to the foreign rights involved in the April 3, 1980 settlement.\u201d ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 722 F.2d 988, 997 (2d Cir.1983). Since the primary asset acquired by ABKCO in 1978 was the infringement claim against \u201cMy Sweet Lord,\u201d the district court made its allocation based upon the global revenues of \u201cMy Sweet Lord.\u201d\nThe district court attributed all the foreign revenues from \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d to ABKCO. ABKCO argues that the court erred because ABKCO\u2019s purchase of Bright Tunes did not entitle ABKCO to all the foreign revenues. This is true in two respects, only one of which affects the validity of the district court\u2019s allocation.\nAs the 1977 settlement as to United Kingdom revenues made clear, the Harrison interests were entitled to a significant portion of the revenues from \u201cMy Sweet Lord.\u201d This entitlement, however, would' presumably be operative as to both domestic and foreign revenues, and therefore does not invalidate the district court\u2019s allocation. On the other hand, the foreign revenues were subject to significant partic-ipations by foreign subpublishers, and the domestic revenues were not. It seems to me that the district court erred in making no allowance for this factor in its allocation, and I would therefore require reconsideration of this issue on remand, especially since remand is required in any event with respect to other issues.",
