        "text": "HOLMES, District Judge.\nLisa Wilcox appeals the judgment of the district court granting the United States\u2019 motion to substitute parties and motion to dismiss, and Lake Regional Health Systems\u2019 (Lake Regional) motion for summary judgment. We affirm.\nI.\nOn June 28, 2013, Wilcox filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Camden County, Missouri alleging' negligence against Dr. Robert Nielsen and Dr. Russell Johnson after they allegedly failed to diagnose her cancer. Wilcox added Lake Regional, a non-profit hospital, and Richland Medical Center (Richland), a federally supported health center, as defendants based on their alleged vicarious liability for the actions of Nielsen and Johnson. On January 8, 2014, Wilcox\u2019s case was dismissed, without prejudice, because she was unable to produce affidavits of merit required by Missouri law.\nWilcox refiled her petition against'the same parties in the Circuit .Court of Camden \u25a0 County on. January 5, 2015, and amended it on June 19, 2015.\nWilcox filed a Federal Tort Claims Act claim with the Department of Health and Human Services on January 5, 2016.\nOn February 12, 2016, the United States filed a notice of removal. On February 18, 2016, the United States filed a notice of substitution of the United States as the proper party-defendant in place of Nielsen, Johnson, and Richland.\nOn March 3, 2016, the United States filed a motion to dismiss based on Wilcox\u2019s failure to timely file her administrative claims.\nOn May 4, 2016, Lake Regional filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Nielsen and Johnson were not employees of Lake Regional.\nOn September 8, 2016, the district court granted the United States\u2019 motion to substitute parties and its motion to dismiss. On October 12, 2016, the district court granted Lake Regional\u2019s motion for summary judgment,\nWilcox subsequently filed this appeal. On appeal, she abandons her claims against Johnson.\nIL\nWilcox contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for Lake Regional because the hospital demonstrated the requisite degree of control over Nielsen to qualify him as an employee. We disagree.\nWe review \u201ca district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, affirming if \u2018there is no genuine dispute. as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d B.M. ex rel. Miller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F,3d 882,\u25a0 886 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ-. P. 56(a)).\nUnder' Missouri law, Wilcox may \u25a0not recover against Lake Regional for the alleged negligence of Nielsen if he is not an employee of Lake Regional. See Jefferson ex rel. Jefferson v. Missouri Baptist Med. Ctr., 447 S.W.3d 701, 705 (Mo. Ct. App. 2014), reh\u2019g and/or transfer denied (Sept. 22, 2014), transfer denied (Nov. 25, 2014), (citing Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 538.210).\nStaff privileges permit a doctor to .use hospital facilities to practice medicine. Engelstad v. Virginia Mun. Hosp., 718 F.2d 262, 267 (8th Cir. 1983). Staff privileges alone do not establish an employment relationship with a hospital. Id. (\u201cStaff privileges do not establish an employment contract with the hospital.\u201d). Instead, staff privileges serve to define the limits of a doctor\u2019s ability to practice in a hospital based on his or her competence in a particular field. Id.\nThe record demonstrates that Nielsen had an exclusive employment\u2019 contract with Richland and never entered into an employment contract with Lake Regional. Wilcox\u2019s argument that Nielsen is an employee of Lake Regional is based solely on Nielsen having staff privileges\" at the hospital.' Wilcox provides a number of examples .of Lake Regional\u2019s alleged control over Nielsen. These include Lake Regional maintaining a.file that contained Nielsen\u2019s credentials, referring to him as \u201con staff,\u201d allowing him to treat patients at the hospital, and requiring him to follow its bylaws and policies. However, these facts simply demonstrate that Nielsen complied with Lake Regional\u2019s requirements to -obtain and maintain staff privileges.\n\u25a0Nielsen\u2019s staff privileges demonstrate that Lake Regional viewed him as competent and allowed him to use its facilities. See id. They do not in any way demonstrate that Nielsen was employed by Lake \u2022Regional. See id. Because Wilcox has not offered any other support for her assertion that Nielsen was employed by Lake Regional, she cannot show a genuine dispute of material fact.\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Lake Regional.\nm.\nWilcox contends that the district court erred in granting the-United States\u2019 motion to substitute because Nielsen was not a federal employee acting within the scope of his employment at a federal agency. We disagree.\nWe review the district court\u2019s order granting substitution of the United States de novo. See McAdams v. Reno, 64 F.3d 1137, 1144 (8th Cir. 1995).\nUpon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his [federal] office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed ... to the district court of the United States ... Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be - an action or proceeding brought against the United States ... and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). \u201c[T]he Attorney General\u2019s certification ... is prima facie evidence that the employee\u2019s challenged conduct was within the scope of employ.\u201d Brown v. Armstrong, 949 F.2d 1007, 1012 (8th Cir. 1991).\nThe United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri and senior counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services certified that Nielsen was a federal employee. This certification is prima facie evidence that Nielsen was acting within the scope of his federal employment.\nWilcox attempts to rebut this prima fa-cie evidence by arguing that Nielsen was not a federal employee acting within the scope of his federal employment because he was employed by Lake Regional. However, as discussed above, Wilcox has failed to demonstrate that Nielsen was an-employee of Lake Regional. Accordingly, she cannot rebut the prima facie evidence that Nielsen was a federal employee. The district court did not err in granting the United States\u2019 motion to substitute.\nIV.\nWilcox argues that the ' district court erred in granting the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss because she timely filed her federal tort claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(5). We disagree.\n\u201cOur review of an order granting a motion to dismiss is de novo.\u201d Coons v. Mineta, 410 F.3d 1036, 1039 (8th Cir. 2005).\nWilcox alleges that her doctors failed to diagnose her cancer on or about July 1, 2011, and that she was not properly diagnosed until June 4, 2012. Using the date of Wilcox\u2019s cancer diagnosis as the date of accrual, her January 5, 2016 administrative tort claim was filed more than three years after her claim accrued. See Motley v. United States, 295 F.3d 820, 822 (8th Cir. 2002) (\u201c[I]n medical malpractice cases, the claim accrues when the \u2018plaintiff actually knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, the cause and \u2019existence of his injury,\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted).\n\u201cA tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). However, under \u00a7 2679(d)(5) a claim is deemed timely even though a plaintiff has not technically complied with the statute of limitations in \u00a7 2401(b). Estate of Bumann v. United States, 2012 WL 4434712, at *2 (N.D. Iowa Sept. 24, 2012). In order for a claim to be timely under \u00a7 2679(d)(5), four requirements must be met: \u201c(1) there must be an initial cause of action in which the United States was substituted as the party defendant; (2) the initial cause of action must have be[e]n dismissed pursuant to Section 2675(a); (3) the initial cause of action must have been filed within the 2 year statute of limitations period required under Section 2401(b); and (4) after dismissal of the initial cause of action, the plaintiff must have filed the instant action with the appropriate federal agency within 60 days.\u201d Id. (summarizing the requirements of \u00a7 2679(d)(5)).\nDespite filing her federal tort claim more than two years after her claim accrued, Wilcox argues that her claim was timely under \u00a7 2679(d)(5). This argument fails because Wilcox cannot meet the second requirement of \u00a7 2679(d)(5) as articulated by the court in Bumann. Wilcox\u2019s initial claim was dismissed without prejudice because she was unable to produce affidavits of merit required by Missouri law. Her claim was not dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to \u00a7 2675(a). Accordingly, she cannot meet the requirements to demonstrate that her claim was timely under \u00a7 2679(d)(5).\nWilcox also argues that her claim was timely filed under the Missouri savings statute and that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled. We reject both of these arguments. The Missouri savings statute does not apply here. See Wollman v. Gross, 637 F.2d 544, 549 (8th Cir. 1980) (holding that Congress did not intend \u201cto allow the state statute of limitations to apply whenever plaintiff is unaware of the status of the defendant as a federal employee acting within the scope of his employment.\u201d); see also In re Franklin Sav. Corp., 385 F.3d 1279, 1288 (10th Cir. 2004) (\u201cAlthough state law determines whether there is substantive liability under the FTCA, federal law defines the applicable limitations period.\u201d) (citations omitted). Further, Wilcox has provided no evidence that she could not have ascertained that Nielsen was a federal employee and, as such, the statute of limitations should not be equitably tolled. See Motley, 295 F.3d at 824 (\u201cTo toll the statute because of a plaintiffs ignorance of the defendant\u2019s federal employee status, plaintiff \u2018must at the very least show that the information could not have been found by a timely diligent inquiry....\u2019\u201d) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in granting the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss.\nV.\nThe distinct court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in all respects.\n.
