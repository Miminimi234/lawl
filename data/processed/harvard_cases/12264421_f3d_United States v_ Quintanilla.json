        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nBefore the Court are seventeen consolidated criminal appeals presenting essentially the same, questipn of law: whether each defendant is entitled to a two-level reduction to offense leyel under Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which permits such a reduction for sentences based on the drug, quantity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, when the original sentence in each case was calculated starting from the higher guideline range for career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As explained further below, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a district court to modify a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d Because we hold that the sentences in these appeals were not \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s drug quantity range but rather on \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s higher career offender guideline range, the district court was without authority as a matter of law to modify the sentences, and the judgments of the district court must be REVERSED.\nI. Background\nNot only do all seventeen appeals present the same issue of law, but the relevant facts and applicable law are the same in all material respects. The relevant facts are as follows: Each defendant was convicted of a drug crime, which resulted in a guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1 based on the drug quantity. Each defendant also qualified as a career offender, resulting in a guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1 based on that status. In each case, the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender guideline range was higher than the \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity range.\nUnder \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), \u201cif the offense level for a career offender from the table in this [career offender] subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply.\u201d Thus, the higher \u00a7 4B1.1 guideline range was the required starting range for each defendant. The district court at each original sentencing in fact applied the higher \u00a7 4B1.1 guideline range. From that range, the district court applied various reductions that are not at issue in these cases. The final sentence was typically somewhere between the starting \u00a7 4B1.1 range and the lower \u00a7 2D1.1 range, though in some cases the final sentence, after all appropriate reductions, was within or even lower than the original \u00a7 2D1.1 range. Of course, if the court had started at the \u00a7 2D1.1 range and applied all of those reductions, the sentence would have been lower still.\nAfter the original sentencings, the Sentencing Commission enacted Amendment 782, effective November 1, 2014 and retroactive to earlier sentences, which amended \u00a7 2D1.1 to allow a two-level reduction to offense level based on the drug quantity. The amendment affects \u00a7 2D1.1 and a few other minor sections tied to \u00a7 2D1.1, but it does not change \u00a7 4B1.1 in any way. In Amendment 782\u2019s \u201cReason for Amendment\u201d section, the Sentencing Commission stated that \u201cexisting statutory enhancements, such as those available under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and guideline enhancements for offenders who possess firearms, use violence, have an aggravating role in the offense, or are repeat or career offenders, ensure that the most dangerous or serious offenders will continue to receive appropriately severe sentences.\u201d\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has authority to modify a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l):\nIn a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (d) below [NB: subsection (d) includes Amendment 782], the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.\nEach of the defendants applied for and received a two-level reduction under Amendment 782. In its virtually identical orders granting the defendants\u2019 motions to reduce the sentence, the district court:\n[found] that Movant [was] eligible for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his original sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the amended guideline \u00a7 2D1.1.... See \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see also [Freeman v. United States, 564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2695, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) ] (allowing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction with a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement if agreed sentence was based on the guidelines).... In the instant case, Movant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the drug guideline range.... Just like when the parties to an 11(c)(1)(C) binding plea agreement may choose a downward departure tied to a drug guideline range, a judge may depart to a sentence otherwise tied to the initial drug guideline range. The sentence would still be \u201cbased on\u201d the drug guideline range under Freeman.\nThe district court also cited United States v. Jackson, 678 F.3d 442, 445 (6th Cir. 2012), for the proposition that a sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 if the district court clearly considered the lower drug quantity guidelines in downwardly departing from a higher applicable guideline range. Using this definition, the district court not only found that each defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity range, but that each defendant was in fact entitled to a two-level reduction.\nThe government timely appealed each case on the ground that each defendant\u2019s original sentence was based on the career offender guideline range in \u00a7 4B1.1, not the lower drug quantity guideline range in \u00a7 2D1.1.\nII. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\nWe have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s sentence modification under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. \u201c[W]e review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d \u201c \u2018A district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d\nIII. Analysis\nThe crux of the issue is whether each defendant\u2019s original sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the drug quantity guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1 or \u201cbased on\u201d the career offender guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. Stated differently, the question under \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) in each case is whether the \u201cguideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered.\u201d Amendment 782 lowered only the \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity guideline range, so if the \u00a7 2D1.1 guideline range was not \u201capplicable to [a] defendant,\u201d then that defendant cannot receive a reduction under \u00a7 1B1.10 or \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\nThe government argues that the district court based its decision on inapposite legal authorities. Specifically, it argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Freeman is irrelevant because Freeman concerned a plea. agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), which is not at issue in any of these sentences. The government also correctly observes that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in Henderson, supra, and the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Jackson, supra, cited by the district court, are factually inapposite to the cases before us and do not provide authority for finding that the- defendants\u2019 original sentences here were \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s drug quantity guideline range when they were subject to a higher \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender guideline range.\nFurthermore, the government points o\u00fat that the Fifth Circuit has already held, in United States v. Valdez, 615 Fed.Appx. 191, 192 (5th Cir. 2015), that a defendant may not obtain a reduction under Amendment 782 if his or her sentence was calculated from the higher career offender guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. The government notes that the unpublished opinion in Valdez. is consistent with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s treatment of a previous amendment concerning the crack cocaine guidelines in United States v. Anderson, 591 F.3d 789 (5th Cir. 2009). The Anderson rule is consistent with the result reached by other circuits on both Amendment 782 and similar previous amendments, Indeed, there is even more authority than the government cited. At least four mor\u00e9 unpublished Fifth Circuit opinions have concluded that a defendant is not ehtitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 if that defendant was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. There are no cases reaching the district court\u2019s contrary result.\nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit strengthened the Anderson rule even further in United States v. Banks, 770 F.3d 346 (5th Cir. 2014), making it clear now that to determine under \u00a7 1B1.10 what is the \u201cguideline range applicable to that defendant,\u201d we look only to the highest guideline range applicable at the time he or she seeks resentencing, even if another range was higher at the time of the original sentencing.\nIn Banks, the defendant\u2019s drug quantity guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1 (38/VI) was higher than his career offender guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1 (37/VI), so he was originally sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1. A few years later, in 2008, he sought a two-level reduction based on the crack cocaine guidelines amendments under \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court granted the reduction under \u00a7 2D1.1, but because his \u00a7 2D1.1 range was now lower than his \u00a7 4B1.1 range, the court recalculated his sentence starting with the \u00a7 4B1.1 range as his base guideline range, still in effect giving him a one-level reduction.\nThe defendant later sought another reduction under Amendment 750, which had once again changed the drug quantity calculation under \u00a7\u25a0 2Dl.l, but the Fifth Circuit rejected the reduction on the ground that the sentence he was currently serving, i.e., the one in effect after the 2008 resen-tencing, was not \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 but was \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 4B1.1 \u2014 even though the defendant\u2019s original sentence had been based on the then-higher \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity guideline range. A recent unpublished Fifth Circuit opinion applied the Banks rule to preclude an Amendment 782 reduction under similar facts..\nThe consolidated appeals here are far simpler. There is no question that the career offender guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1 was higher than the drug quantity guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1, so under the Anderson/Banks rule, we must conclude that all 17 sentences were \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 4B1.1 and not on \u00a7 2D1.1, i.e., that under \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) the \u201cguideline range applicable to that defendant\u201d was the career offender range under \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Amendment 782 did not lower the guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1, none of the defendants is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7. lB1.10(a)(l) or \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Consequently, the district court lacked the authority as a matter of law to modify the defendants\u2019 sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and it therefore abused its discretion by granting the reductions.\nFor their part, the defendants attempt to sidestep the outcome required by the above cases by claiming Congress intended sentence reductions to be broader under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) than the Sentencing Commission suggested under \u00a7 lR1.10(a)(l), i.e., that \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s language (\u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d) is broader than \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)\u2019s language (\u201cguideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual\u201d). The defendants argue that \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s use of \u201cbased on\u201d is broad enough to include the district court\u2019s reasoning that a sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 even if the \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity guideline range was lower than the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender guideline range. This argument is foreclosed by the Anderson/Banks rule, however.\nThe only remaining question is the cross-appeal of defendant Michael Scott Cooksey in United States v. Cooksey, No. 16-50689. Cooksey pleaded guilty to two counts: (1) conspiring to possess five grams or more of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute it, and (2) possessing and concealing counterfeit U.S. currency. His offense level was calculated by breaking the counts down into two separate groups: the drug count and the counterfeit-obligations count. Because of the grouping rules, \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s drug quantity range provided the base offense level for both counts. The drug count resulted in an offense level of 26, while the counterfeit-obligations count, resulting in an offense level of 9, was disregarded. However, these were dwarfed by the career offender guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1, which established a base offense level of 34.\nThe district court reduced Cooksey\u2019s drug count sentence as it did with all the other defendants, but it did not reduce his sentence on the counterf\u00e9ifc-obligations count and did not explain why. Cooksey has filed a cross-appeal arguing that he is entitled to a reduction on his counterfeit-obligations sentence under \u00a7 2D1.1 as well. Cooksey is not entitled to relief on his cross-claim for the same reason his sentence reduction should- be reversed under the above analysis. Cooksey\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d his career offender'status under \u00a7 4B1.1, so he was not entitled to a reduction on either count under Amendment 782.\nIY. Conclusion\nThe district court\u2019s judgments in all seventeen consolidated cases are REVERSED, and the sentences in effect before the district court\u2019s reduction are hereby reinstated. As a matter of law, the district court was without authority to modify any of the sentences under Amendment 782.\n. One of them, United States v. Cooksey, No. 16-50689, also presents one small additional issue, discussed at the end of this opinion.\n. In United States v. Grimes, No. 16-50690, the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2D1.1 range was 130-162 months, and the \u00a7 4B1.1 range was 262-327 months, but the final sentence after substantial reductions was 151 months, within the original \u00a7 2D 1.1 range. In United States v. Parada, No. 16-50700, United States v. Morrison, No. 16-50705, United States v. Sotelo, No. 16-50707, and United States v. Golden, No. 15-50709, the final sentence, after all reductions, was lower than the \u00a7 2D 1,1 range.\n. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 782 (2014).\n. Id. (emphasis added).\n.
