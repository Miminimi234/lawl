      {
        "text": "Reversed and remanded by published opinion. Judge Motz wrote the opinion, in which Judge Agee and Judge Floyd joined.\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge:\nMaryam. Balbed brings this action, contending that her former, employer, .Eden Park Guest. House, failed to compensate her for all the time, that she worked and failed to pay her overtime wages in violation of the Fair .Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), the Maryland Wage and Hour Law, and the Montgomery County minimum, wage requirement. Balbed appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Eden Park. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI.\nEden Park Guest House is a small family-owned bed and breakfast located in Ta-koma Park, Maryland. In July 2015, Eden Park hired Balbed to serve as its innkeeper. The parties entered into a written agreement, in which Eden Park paid Bal-bed $800/month and provided her with a room in the inn, laundry, utilities, and daily breakfast. In exchange, Balbed agreed to answer phones, make reservations, reply to emails, check guests in and out, serve breakfast to guests, clean public areas, and guest rooms, and manage Eden Park\u2019s social media presence.\nThe agreement set forth a daily schedule that divided Balbed\u2019s time into three categories: (1) serve breakfast to gu\u00e9sts daily (for a total of seven hours per week); (2) clean the guests rooms and common spaces five days a week (for a total of twenty-two hours per week); and (3) as necessary, check in guests between 4:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and close the bed and breakfast at 10:00 p.m. \u201cunless otherwise specified.\u201d Thus, the contract provided Balbed would work 29 hours per week on the first two categories, but did not specify the amount of time required for the third\u2014checking guests in and out, as necessary\u2014or for the additional duties listed that did not fall into any of these three categories: answering phones, making reservations, replying to emails, and managing Eden Park\u2019s social media presence.\nEden Park contends that the contract required 29 hours of work per week, entitling Balbed to $1107.80/month. Eden Park maintains that it compensated Bal-bed with an amount in excess of this because it paid Balbed $800/month and provided her lodging that it valued as worth between $850/month and $1800/month. Balbed challenges that assessment of the lodging\u2019s value and claims that, notwithstanding the contract, she worked in excess of 100 hours per week nearly every week without a day off.\nEden Park employed Balbed from July 2015 through January 2016. She filed this suit on January 19, 2016 and quit shortly after.\nBalbed moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that Eden Park could not receive any credit for her room and board, because it did not maintain records of the cost of room and board. Balbed also contended that Eden Park did not pay her a minimum wage, because the cash payment did not compensate her for all the hours she worked.\nEden Park cross-moved for summary judgment, maintaining that the parties\u2019 written contract constituted a \u201creasonable agreement\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.28, and that this exempted Eden Park from all other FLSA requirements. The district court agreed with Eden Park, concluding that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 carved out an exception to the other FLSA regulatory requirements for recordkeeping and calculation of in-kind wages. Because the court found the parties\u2019 contract constituted a reasonable agreement within the meaning of \u00a7 785.23, it granted summary judgment to Eden Park.\nWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Libertarian Party of Va. v. Judd, 718 F.3d 308, 312 (4th Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\nII.\nA.\nThis case involves the interaction of several regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor pursuant to its authority under the FLSA. That statute requires employers to pay their employees an hourly minimum wage, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a), at either the federal wage rate or the applicable state or local rate, whichever is higher, id. \u00a7 218(a). The statute entitles employees to overtime pay for all hours worked over forty per week at one and one-half times their ordinary rate of pay. Id. \u00a7 207(a)(1).\nSection 203(m) of the statute provides that \u201cwages\u201d include cash and, under certain circumstances, \u201cthe reasonable cost ... to the employer of furnishing fthe] employee with board, lodging, or other facilities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203. The Department of Labor regulations, promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 203(m), provide that to claim the credit for lodging as wages, an employer must ensure that:\n1. The lodging is regularly provided by the employer or similar employers, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.31;\n2. The employee voluntarily accepts the lodging, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.30;\n3. The lodging is furnished in compliance with applicable federal, state, or local law, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.31;\n4. The lodging is provided primarily for the benefit of the employee rather than the employer, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3(d)(1); and\n5. The employer maintains accurate records of the costs incurred in furnishing the lodging, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27(a).\nU.S. Dep\u2019t. of Labor, Wage and Hour Div., Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2015-1 (Dec. 17, 2015); see also U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Labor, Credit Towards Wages Under Section 3(m), https://www.dol.gov/whd/homecare/ credit_wages_faq.htm (last visited Jan. 10, 2018) [hereinafter DOL \u00a7 203(m) Manual].\nSection 207(a)(1) of the statute provides for the calculation of overtime hours. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). A Department of Labor regulation promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 207(a)(1) sets forth rules regarding the calculation of hours worked where an employee lives on the employer\u2019s premises:\nAn employee who resides on his employer\u2019s premises on a permanent basis or for extended periods of time is not considered as working all the time he is on the premises. Ordinarily, he may engage in normal private pursuits and thus have enough time for eating, sleeping, entertaining, and other periods of complete freedom from all duties when he may leave the premises for purposes of his own. It is, of course, difficult to determine the exact hours worked under these circumstances and any reasonable agreement of the parties which takes into consideration all of the pertinent facts will be accepted. ...\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 (2004) (emphasis added).\nB.\nEden Park contends that the FLSA regulations that govern the \u00a7 203(m) lodging credit do not apply here. Relying on our unpublished opinion in Myers v. Baltimore County, 50 Fed.Appx. 583 (4th Cir. 2002), Eden Park argues that the value of room and board need not conform to \u00a7 203(m)\u2019s requirements (contained in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531 and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516) if an employer and employee reach a \u201creasonable\u201d agreement under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23.\nEden Park misreads Myers. There, we held that the district court did not err in finding that an agreement between Baltimore County and caretakers for the county parks, which provided for on-site accommodation in exchange for a caretaker\u2019s continuous presence in the park and the performance of other duties, was reasonable under \u00a7 785.23. 50 Fed.Appx. at 585-86, 589. The parties in Myers, however, did not dispute the value of the on-site accommodation. See id. at 589. Thus, Myers provides no support for Eden Park\u2019s contention that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23, governing hours worked by an employee who lives in lodging provided by his employer, eliminates the need to comply with the \u00a7 203(m)\u2019s requirements, governing the wages earned for the hours worked. Nor does any other case or regulation support such a result.\nIn fact, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 simply provides a limited exception to the general requirement that an employee must be compensated for all hours actually spent at work. Thus, that, regulation allows employers and employees to reach a \u201creasonable agreement\u201d regarding the number of hours presumptively worked when an employee resides on the employer\u2019s premises. This narrow exception to determining hours worked has no bearing on an employer\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 203(m) when supplementing cash wages with in-kind compensation like board or lodging.\nThe employment agreement between Eden Park and Balbed had to comply with the requirements that govern not just 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23, but also \u00a7 203(m). The district court failed to make a finding as to whether Eden Park\u2019s in-kind compensation conformed to the requirements under \u00a7 203(m) and its implementing regulations. Nor did the court assess all the \u201cpertinent facts\u201d in determining the reasonableness of the employment agreement under 29 C.F.R, \u00a7 785.23. We address these issues in turn.\nm.\nEden Park estimates that the lodging it provided to Balbed as in-kind compensation had a value between $850/month and $1800/month. The $850 estimate relies on the asserted knowledge of the. local rental market by the inn\u2019s General Manager. The .$1,800 estimate rests on the price Eden Park charged guests to, stay in an upstairs guestroom. Thus, according to Eden Park, even if its. agreement with Balbed required her to work not just 29 but 40 hours per -week, the value of the lodging ($850-$1800 a month), combined with the $800 monthly cash wages and other in-kind benefits (utilities and breakfast), exceeded the minimum wage. But in calculating the value of the lodging and other in-Mnd items, Eden Park relies on their purported market value, which includes profit. Department of Labor regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 203(m) prohibit this type of alteration. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3(b).\nThe regulations provide only two ways to calculate the value of in-kind compensation\u2014reasonable cost or fair value\u2014and an employer must use whichever is less. 29 C.F.R. \u2022\u00a7 531.3(c). The reasonable cost of housing \u201cdoes not include a profit to the employer.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3(b). As for fair value, the regulations make clear that an employer may .only use the fair value of housing as the amount credited toward wages if the fair value is equal to or lower than the amount the employer actually pays for the housing. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3(c). The regulations direct employers to calculate the actual cost of providing lodging to an employee by apportioning the monthly mortgage, rental payments, and utility payments. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.4; see also DOL \u00a7 203(m) Manual.\nEden Park has. not attempted to meet these requirements. Moreover, Balbed .maintains that Eden Park cannot do - so now because the inn failed to keep contemporaneous records. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27(a) (\u201c[A]n employer who makes deductions from..wages of employees for \u2018board, lodging, or other facilities\u2019 ... shall maintain and preserve records.\u201d). DOL regulations require an employer claiming the \u00a7 203(m) .wage credit for lodging to keep two lands of records: (1) records regarding the cost to the employer, of providing the housing and (2) records regarding wage calculations taking lodging into account. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 516.27(a)(1), (b). Since Eden Park did not produce such records, Balbed contends that Eden Park is now precluded from using the value of the lodging as in-kind'compensation.\nIn support of this contention, Balbed relies primarily on Donovan v. New Floridian Hotel, Inc., 676 F.2d 468 (11th Cir. 1982). There the Eleventh Circuit r\u00e9jected the employers\u2019 effort to deduct the cost of meals and lodging in a case in which they assertedly had not kept the records required by the regulations. However, the Donovan holding rested on the fact that the employers \u201cfailed to sustain their burden of proving \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 of the meals and lodging.\u201d Id. at 473. The court specifically did not address the validity of the argument that the employers\u2019 failure \u201cto maintain records\u201d deprived them of the ability to deduct the cost of meals and lodging. Id.\nWe believe that if Eden Park can provide a reconstruction of records that the district court deems reasonable, those reconstructed records can be used to as.sess Balbed\u2019s appropriate wages. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27(a)(2) (\u201cNo particular degree of itemization is prescribed. However the amount of detail shown ... should be sufficient to enable ... [an] authorized representative to verify the nature of the expenditure and the amount by reference to the basic records.\u201d). Courts have.accepted reasonable reconstructions of records in a variety of contexts. See In re French, 499 F.3d 345, 355 (4th Cir. 2007) (explaining that a debtor need not maintain perfect records, but must preserve sufficient records to enable the court to reasonably reconstruct an accurate picture of debtor\u2019s finances); Cebollero v. C.I.R., 967 F.2d 986, 989 (4th Cir. 1992) (clarifying that \u201c[w]here the taxpayer fails to keep or produce adequate records from which his income can be determined,\u201d, the IRS may \u201cresort to the best procedure available under the circumstances\u201d to reconstruct the records (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Archie v. Grand Cent. P\u2019ship, Inc., 86 F.Supp.2d 262, 266 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\u201c[T]hat defendants did not maintain records showing deductions from wages on a workweek basis, as required under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27(b) for employers who provide benefits as wages, does not mandate denial of deductions now.\u201d). It seems appropriate to permit an attempt at such a reconstruction here.\nOn remand, after Eden Park offers the evidence required by \u00a7 203(m), the district court should make a finding as to the reasonable cost of the lodging and other in-kind benefits that Eden Park provided to Balbed.\nIV.\nFinally, we consider the hours required by the agreement under the 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 analysis. That regulation reflects a recognition that in employment relationships where employees reside on the employer\u2019s premises, it may be difficult to determine the exact number of hours worked. For this reason, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 provides that \u201cany reasonable agreement of the parties which takes into consideration all of the pertinent facts will be accepted.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 (emphasis added).\nThe regulation necessarily governs a range of employment relationships and circumstances. Thus, there is no single generic test for \u201creasonableness\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23. Courts have found that an agreement reached pursuant to this regulation \u201cis binding if it is reasonable in light of \u2018all of the pertinent facts\u2019 of the employment relationship.\u201d See Garofolo v. Donald B. Heslep Assocs., 405 F.3d 194, 199 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23); accord Leever v. Carson City, 360 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir. 2004); Brock v. City of Cincinnati, 236 F.3d 793, 806 (6th Cir. 2001) (explaining that an agreement is reasonable under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 if it \u201cfalls within a broad zone of reasonableness, considering its terms and all of the facts and circumstances of the parties\u2019 relationship\u201d).\nBalbed argues that, notwithstanding the value of the in-kind benefits, the contract was not a \u201creasonable agreement\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23. The contract between Eden Park and Balbed may or may not fall within the \u201cbroad zone of reasonableness\u201d accorded to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23 agreements. See Brock, 236 F.3d at 806. On remand, the district court can assess this by examining \u201call of the pertinent facts\u201d in the employment relationship. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.23; Garofolo, 405 F.3d at 199-201.\nThus, on remand, the court should consider how many hours Balbed presumptively worked each day by examining whether Balbed was \u201cengaged to wait\u201d or \u201cwaiting] to be engaged\u201d during the \u201ccheck-in\u201d hours specified in the contract. See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 136-137, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). The face of the contract suggests that Balbed was required to work 29 hours at a minimum, and dictates periods of time where Balbed would be essentially \u201con-call\u201d (4:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. each night). Under the FLSA, hours worked include all time spent performing tasks for the benefit of the employer or waiting to perform such tasks (i.e. being \u201cengaged to wait\u201d). See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U.S. 21, 25-26, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005); Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 137, 65 S.Ct. 161. The Supreme Court has explained that whether waiting time is work time under the FLSA raises \u201ca question of fact to be resolved by appropriate findings of the trial court .... Facts may show that the employee was engaged to wait, or they may show that he waited to be engaged.\u201d Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 136-37, 65 S.Ct. 161. Whether Balbed was \u201cengaged to wait\u201d or \u201cwaiting] to be engaged\u201d during the \u201ccheck-in and closing time\u201d therefore constitutes a question of fact to be resolved by the district court. Id.\nFor example, in Kelly v. Hines-Rinaldi Funeral Home, Inc., 847 F.2d 147, 148 (4th Cir. 1988), the plaintiff sought \u201covertime pay under the 'theory that he was employed ... to work from 9:00 p.m. until 8:30 a.m. the next morning, six days a week.\u201d The district court used the Skidmore test to address whether the plaintiff was \u201cengaged to wait\u201d or \u201cwaiting] to be engaged\u201d between midnight and 6:30 a.m. Id. at 148^9 (citing Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 136-137, 65 S.Ct. 161). The district court concluded that those hours could not be considered working time because most of the night hours were available for the plaintiffs uninterrupted use at his own on-site residence. Id. at 148. This court affirmed. Id. at 149. If the district court in the case at hand similarly concludes that Balbed \u201cwaited to be engaged,\u201d then those hours should not be considered working time. But if the court concludes that Bal-bed was \u201cengaged to vrait\u201d during the \u201ccheck-in\u201d hours, Eden Park is obligated to compensate her for those hours.\nOn remand, the district court should also address Balbed\u2019s contention that the agreement \u201cprovide[s] an unreasonably short amount of time to perform the assigned tasks.\u201d Garofolo, 405 F.3d at 201 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Eden Park maintains that the contract only requires 29 hours of work per week. The face of the contract indicates that serving breakfast and cleaning guest rooms and common areas requires 29 hours. But the contract also provides that Balbed will answer phones, make reservations, reply to emails, and manage Eden Park\u2019s social media presence. Therefore, the district court should make a finding as to whether it was reasonable for Eden Park to require Balbed to complete these additional tasks within the 29-hour time frame. Given the individual circumstances of this case, this may (or may not) have been reasonable. See Leever, 360 F.3d at 1021 (explaining that an employer is obligated to make an investigation as to the number of hours employees were required to work and to take a reasonable estimate of such hours into account).\nV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n. Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.32, \u201cother facilities\u201d may include meals, utilities, and additional i in-kind items. To the extent that Eden Park intends to claim a wage credit for these \u201cother facilities\u201d furnished to Balbed, it must comply with the same requirements laid out here with respect to lodging.\n. Records regarding the cost to the employer of providing the housing should \"include itemized accounts showing the nature and amount of any expenditures entering into the computation of the reasonable cost,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27(a)(1). Moreover, if\u2014because of a \u00a7 203(m) credit\u2014an employee receives less in cash wages than the minimum wage for each hour worked in the workweek, \"the employer shall maintain records showing on a workweek basis those additions to or deductions from wages.\u201d- 29 C.F.R, \u00a7 516.27(b).\n. Balbed also maintains that Eden Park failed to satisfy the third requirement necessary to claim the \u00a7 203(m) credit: that the lodging must be furnished in compliance with applicable federal, state, or local law. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.31. Balbed argues that Eden Park did not obtain a permit to use a cellar for sleeping as required by Montgomery County Code \u00a7 26-5(e)-(f). Eden Park maintains that the room it provided is not in a cellar, but a basement, for which no permit is required. The district court did not address whether the lodging complied with Montgomery County Code \u00a7 26-5(e)-(f). On remand, it should do so,\n. The district court\u2019s summary judgment order rested on the fact that \"the parties don't dispute that at least nomina,lly the contract appears to require 29 hours of service.\u201d Joint Appendix 909 (emphasis added). Eden Park argues that Balbed has conceded that the employment agreement required only 29 hours per week and, therefore, is precluded from arguing that it required her to work for more than 29 hours per week. We disagree with Eden Park. As the district court recognized in its oral ruling, Balbed conceded only that the agreement required her to work for at least 29 hours.\n. The district court disposed of the state and local law claims by concluding that Eden Park complied with the FLSA. Balbed argues that even if Eden Park prevails under the FLSA, her state law claims remain. Eden Park contends that those claims are preempted. Since \u00a7 785.23 allows the parties to enter into a \"reasonable agreement\u201d when it is difficult to ascertain the number of hours \"worked\u201d by a live-in employee, Eden Park maintains that allowing the state law claims to proceed would hinder the federal objective and render \u00a7 785.23 meaningless. See Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 494, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987) (explaining that a state law is preempted \"if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach [that] goal\u201d). We express no opinion on this matter, but remand for initial consideration by the district court.",
