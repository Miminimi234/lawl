        "text": "ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:\nAfter a criminal jury trial, DefendanN Appellant Morgan Siler appeals his conviction and sentence for assaulting a corrections officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b). After careful review, and with the benefit of oral argument, we affirm Siler\u2019s conviction and sentence.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Offense Conduct\nIn June 2008, Siler was a holdover inmate at a federal correctional facility in Georgia while en route to a federal correctional facility in Virginia. One morning while Siler was in the Georgia facility, a corrections officer opened Siler\u2019s cell door so that Siler could get breakfast. Siler placed a homemade rope around the officer\u2019s neck and forcibly choked him. Several officers responded to help and forcibly removed the officer from Siler\u2019s grip.\nB. .Indictment\nIn March 2009, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Siler. Count One charged Siler with attempted murder of a corrections officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(3). Count Two charged that Siler \u201cknowingly and by means and use of a dangerous weapon, that is, a handmade rope, did forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, and interfere with R.M., a Corrections Officer, while he was engaged in his official duties, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 111.\u201d\nC. Trial\nThe jury found Siler not guilty of Count One (attempted murder) and guilty of Count Two (assault on a corrections officer). As it relates to Count Two, the verdict form given to the jury read:\nCount II\n(Assault on Corrections Officer)\nWe the jury find the Defendant MORGAN SILER\n__ Guilty\n_Not Guilty\nWas a deadly or dangerous weapon used?\n__ Yes\n_No\nSiler agreed to the amended verdict form.\nIn its instruction to the jury on Count Two, the district court charged the offense elements as:\nOne, the Defendant forcibly assaulted the person described in the indictment; two, the person assaulted was a federal officer performing an official duty; and, three, the Defendant used a deadly or dangerous weapon.\nThis charge was consistent with Offense Instruction 1.2 from the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions: \u201cForcibly Assaulting a Federal Officer: with Use of a Deadly Weapon or Inflicting Bodily Injury. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b).\u201d The court charged that \u201cforcible assault is an intentional threat or attempt to cause serious bodily injury when the ability to do so is apparent and immediate.\u201d The court clarified that forcible assault \u201cincludes any intentional display of force that would cause a reasonable person to expect immediate and serious bodily harm or death regardless of whether the act is carried out or the person is injured.\u201d The court charged that \u201c[a] deadly or dangerous weapon includes any object that a person can readily use to inflict serious bodily harm on someone else.\u201d The court also charged, \u201cTo show that such a weapon was used, the Government must prove that the Defendant possessed the weapon and intentionally displayed it during the forcible assault.\u201d When describing the verdict form to the jury, the district court instructed that if the jury found Siler guilty of Count Two, the jury must answer the question, \u201cWas a deadly or dangerous weapon used?\u201d\nSiler made no objections to the court\u2019s charge, as given, and Siler expressly agreed to the language of the verdict form. During deliberations, the jury asked the court for a legal definition of deadly or dangerous weapon. With the agreement of the parties, the court re-instructed the jury with the relevant instructions. Siler made no objection to the court\u2019s re-charge.\nThe jury found Siler not guilty of Count One (attempted murder) and guilty of Count Two (assault on a corrections officer). With respect to Count Two, the jury found that Siler used a deadly or dangerous weapon.\nD.Sentencing\nSiler objected to various aspects of his Presentence Investigation Report. After considering and ruling on Siler\u2019s objections, the court calculated a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.\nSiler then argued that the indictment charged Count Two as a misdemeanor because it failed to allege physical contact. Siler argued that \u00a7 111(b) cannot be used to \u201cenhance\u201d the one-year sentence for a misdemeanor offense under \u00a7 111(a) to twenty years. Thus, Siler concluded, \u00a7 111(b) did not apply to his case, and the maximum possible penalty for his misdemeanor offense was twelve months\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe district court overruled Siler\u2019s objection. The court stated, \u201c[T]he jury explicitly found that a dangerous or deadly weapon was used, which ... makes this a felony offense under 111(b).\u201d The court applied an upward variance and sentenced Siler to the statutory maximum penalty under \u00a7 111(b), twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.\nSiler now appeals.\nII. DISCUSSION\nOn appeal, Siler argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. Specifically, Siler argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a) contains two offenses, misdemeanor assault and felony assault, and that felony assault requires proof of physical contact or the intent to commit another felony. Siler argues that \u00a7 111(b) provides for an enhanced penalty only if (1) the defendant is convicted of felony assault under \u00a7 111(a) and (2) the defendant is shown to have used a deadly or dangerous weapon. Siler concludes that because the government did not allege or prove, and the jury did not find, physical contact or the intent to commit another felony, he was necessarily convicted of misdemeanor assault. Thus, Siler contends, he faced a one-year statutory maximum penalty for his misdemeanor assault, and the district court erred by sentencing him to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe current version of \u00a7 111 provides in relevant part as follows:\n(a) In General. \u2014 Whoever\u2014\n(1) forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated [as a federal officer] while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties ...\nshall, where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and where such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both.\n(b) Enhanoed Penalty. \u2014 Whoever, in the commission of any acts described in subsection (a), uses a deadly or dangerous weapon (including a weapon intended to cause death or danger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective component) or inflicts bodily injury, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (emphasis added).\nSiler asserts that \u00a7 111(b) only applies if a defendant has committed an assault that involves physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony. To explain how Siler has misinterpreted the statute, it is helpful to understand that \u00a7 111 establishes three separate crimes. A previous version of \u00a7 111 was addressed in United States v. Martinez, 486 F.3d 1239 (11th Cir.2007). In Martinez \u2014 which involved a conviction under only \u00a7 111(a) \u2014 we observed that three categories of forcible assault are established by \u00a7 111(a) and (b). Id. at 1244. Subsequent to the version addressed in Martinez, amendments in 2002 and 2008 made changes to the statute, but not changes relevant to Martinez\u2019s observation that the statute establishes three categories of forcible assault. The version of \u00a7 111 addressed in Martinez provided as follows:\n(a) In GeneRal. \u2014 Whoever\u2014\n(1) forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated [as a federal officer] while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties ...\nshall, where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and in all other cases, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both.\n(b) EnhanCed Penalty. \u2014 Whoever, in the commission of any acts described in subsection (a), uses a deadly or dangerous weapon (including a weapon intended to cause death or danger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective component) or inflicts bodily injury, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\nOf the three categories of forcible assault recognized in Martinez, the first two were established by subsection (a). The first category was simple assault \u201cwhere the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault,\u201d which was punishable by not more than one year\u2019s imprisonment. The second category within subsection (a) was \u201call other cases\u201d where the acts specified in subsection (a) constituted a felony assault, which was punishable by not more than three (now eight) years. The third category of forcible assault identified in Martinez was established by subsection (b) of \u00a7 111, which provided that \u201c[wjhoever, in the commission of any acts described in subsection (a), uses a deadly or dangerous weapon ... or inflicts bodily injury, shall be ... imprisoned not more than ten [now twenty] years.\u201d\nAlthough Martinez did not expressly say that the three separate categories of \u201cforcible assaults\u201d were separate crimes, and although the issue may not have been presented to that panel, the statement that the statute establishes three categories of \u201cforcible assault\u201d suggests that they are three separate crimes, and certainly is consistent with meaning three separate crimes. Other circuits that have addressed the issue have said that \u00a7 111 creates three separate crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Vela, 624 F.3d 1148, 1159 (9th Cir.2010) (stating that the Ninth Circuit has joined many of the other circuits \u201cin holding that ... \u00a7 111 must be construed to create three distinct criminal offenses, with \u00a7 111(a) containing one misdemeanor and one felony and \u00a7 111(b) containing a second felony\u201d); United States v. Gagnon, 553 F.3d 1021, 1024 (6th Cir.2009) (\u201c[I]t [is] indisputable that \u00a7 111 too must be treated as creating three separate crimes whose elements must all be submitted to a jury rather than as a single crime with three separate punishments determined on the basis of sentencing factors submitted to a judge. Those three crimes are: (1) \u2018simple assault\u2019 (misdemeanor); (2) violations of \u00a7 111 that either involve a deadly or dangerous weapon or result in bodily injury (aggravated felony); or (3) \u2018all other cases\u2019 (felony).\u201d); United States v. Hazlewood, 526 F.3d 862, 865 (5th Cir.2008) (considering the current version of the statute and stating that the Fifth Circuit .\u201chas interpreted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 to create three separate offenses: (1) simple assault; (2) more serious assaults but not involving a dangerous weapon; and (3) assault with a dangerous weapon\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Vallery, 437 F.3d 626, 630 (7th Cir.2006) (stating as settled in the Seventh Circuit the contention of other circuits that \u00a7 111 \u201cconstitute^] three separate offenses: first, misdemeanor simple assault under \u00a7 111(a); second \u2018all other cases\u2019 felony assault under \u00a7 111(a); and third, felony assault involving a deadly or dangerous weapon or resulting in bodily injury under \u00a7 111(b)\u201d); United States v. Hathaway, 318 F.3d 1001, 1007 (10th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e hold that \u00a7 111 defines three separate offenses, each element of which must be charged in the indictment and proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); United States v. Arrington, 309 F.3d 40, 44 & n. 5, 46 (D.C.Cir.2002) (treating \u00a7 111(b) as containing offense elements rather than sentencing factors and stating, \u201cTo convict a defendant of the \u00a7 111(b) offense, the jury must find (inter alia) that he forcibly assaulted (or forcibly resisted, etc.) a federal officer, that he did so intentionally, that he used a dangerous weapon in the commission of that act, and that he used the weapon intentionally\u201d); United States v. Campbell, 259 F.3d 293, 298, 299 (4th Cir.2001) (concluding that \u201cin \u00a7 111(b), Congress created a separate offense from those set forth in \u00a7 111(a)\u201d and that the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon or the infliction of bodily injury constitute elements of \u00a7 111(b) assault rather than mere sentencing factors); United States v. McCulligan, 256 F.3d 97, 102 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cIn the federal scheme ..., \u00a7\u00a7 111(a) and 111(b) create three separate offenses: simple assaults, other \u2018non-simple\u2019 assaults not involving a dangerous weapon or injury, and assaults that involve a dangerous weapon or cause injury.\u201d); United States v. Chestaro, 197 F.3d 600, 607 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]e hold that \u00a7 111(b) defines a separate offense rather than simply a sentencing enhancement.\u201d).\nMoreover, the Supreme Court decision in Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), supports the conclusion that \u00a7 111 creates three separate crimes. In a similar way to the statute in Jones, the three separate categories of forcible assault in \u00a7 111 \u201cnot only provide for steeply higher penalties, but condition them on further facts ... that seem quite as important as the elements in the principal paragraph.\u201d Id. at 233, 119 S.Ct. at 1219. Similarly, as in Jones, the fact that the subsections of \u00a7 111 may have a \u201clook\u201d about them that is suggestive of a sentencing provision is not dispositive. The Court in Jones noted that the statute at issue in that case began with a principal paragraph listing a series of elements that \u201cc[ame] close to standing on its own, followed by sentencing provisions.\u201d Id. at 232, 119 S.Ct. at 1219. Nevertheless, the Court there declared that \u201c[t]he \u2018look\u2019 of the statute, then, is not a reliable guide to congressional intentions,\u201d id. at 233, 119 S.Ct. at 1219, and held that the subsections in that statute created separate offenses by the specification of distinct elements. Id. at 252, 119 S.Ct. at 1228.\nReading \u00a7 111(b), especially in the light of Jones, we conclude that \u00a7 111 establishes three separate crimes. Each has one or more elements of the preceding category or categories, but adds an element or elements upon which is conditioned a steeply increased penalty. Each element has to be charged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the case of a jury trial.\nSiler asserts that \u00a7 111(b) only applies if a defendant is first charged with and found guilty of a felony assault under \u00a7 111(a). More particularly, Siler asserts that \u00a7 111(b) applies only if a defendant is first charged with and found guilty of a forcible assault that involves physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony. Siler misreads the plain language of the statute. Section 111(b) specifically states that whoever \u201cuses a deadly or dangerous weapon\u201d while committing \u201cany acts described in subsection (a) \u201d is subject to a statutory maximum penalty of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. The statute is clear: The twenty-year maximum penalty applies whenever a person commits any act listed in \u00a7 111(a) while using a deadly or dangerous weapon. It does not matter whether that act \u2014 if a deadly or dangerous weapon had not been used \u2014 would have been a misdemeanor or a felony offense, i.e., a simple assault or an assault involving physical contact or the intent to commit another felony. It only matters whether such a weapon was used in the commission of a \u00a7 111(a) offense. Once such an actor uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, he has committed the separate crime under \u00a7 111(b) and has raised his statutory maximum penalty from one or eight years\u2019 imprisonment to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.\nCareful attention to the plain meaning of the statutory language mandates our interpretation of the statute. Section 111(b) clearly provides that whoever commits \u201cany acts described in subsection (a),\u201d and in so doing uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, is guilty of the separate crime provided for in \u00a7 111(b) and is subject to a maximum term of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. To interpret \u00a7 111(b), we have to identify the \u201cacts described in subsection (a).\u201d As noted above, \u00a7 111 describes three separate crimes, the first two of which are contained in \u00a7 111(a), and the third in \u00a7 111(b). The following acts are encompassed in the first separate crime:\nForcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with a person designated [as a federal officer] while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1). In the absence of physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony, the foregoing acts constitute a simple assault, and the maximum imprisonment is one year.\nThe following acts are encompassed in the second separate crime:\nWhere such acts [i.e., any of the acts encompassed in the first separate crime] involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony.\nId. \u00a7 111(a). The maximum imprisonment for this second separate crime is eight years.\nIt is clear that the crucial phrase in \u00a7 111(b) \u2014 \u201cany acts described in subsection (a)\u201d \u2014 includes not only the acts encompassed in the second separate crime, as Siler urges, but it is equally clear that the phrase also includes the acts encompassed in the first separate crime. It follows that physical contact is not required as a predicate act or element of \u00a7 111(b) so long as acts encompassed in the first separate crime were committed and in doing so the defendant used a deadly or dangerous weapon or inflicted bodily injury.\nHere, the jury explicitly found that Siler (1) committed a forcible assault in subsection (a) of \u00a7 111, and (2) that he used a deadly or dangerous weapon during that assault. This is all that \u00a7 111(b) required to convict Siler of the separate crime established in \u00a7 111(b) and to raise Siler\u2019s statutory maximum penalty to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, even if Siler was charged with and found guilty of what would have been \u2014 in the absence of the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon\u2014 a misdemeanor offense under \u00a7 111(a), his use of a deadly or dangerous weapon during that offense transformed his act from a misdemeanor offense with a one-year statutory maximum penalty to a felony offense with a twenty-year statutory maximum penalty.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nBecause the district court sentenced Siler within the applicable statutory maximum penalty of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, we affirm Siler\u2019s conviction and sentence.\nAFFIRMED.\n. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute de novo. United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).\n.This \"all other cases\" phrase was deleted by an amendment effective January 7, 2008, and applicable to Siler\u2019s case. The phrase was replaced by the following: \u201cwhere such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony.\u201d Thus, in the current version of the statute, the second category encompasses \"such acts\" \u2014 i.e., the acts encompassed in the first category \u2014 when such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony.\n. In 2002, an amendment increased this maximum punishment from three years to eight years.\n. In 2002, an amendment increased this maximum punishment from ten years to twenty years.\n. In addition, the fact that \u00a7 111(b) carries the heading \"Enhanced Penalty\u201d is not dis-positive. In Jones, the Supreme Court noted that the heading on the subtitle of the bill creating the federal carjacking statute at issue there read \"Enhanced Penalties for Auto Theft.\u201d 526 U.S. at 232, 119 S.Ct. at 1218. The Court nonetheless concluded that the subsections of the statute established three separate offenses with distinct elements rather than sentencing enhancements. Id. at 252, 119 S.Ct. at 1228. See also Chestaro, 197 F.3d at 607 (citing Jones in recognizing that \u201c[ajlthough the language of \u00a7 111(b), which includes the term 'enhanced penalty,\u2019 suggests otherwise, ... the text of such a provision is not dispositive\u201d).",
