        "text": "OPINION\nHELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge.\nPlaintiffs Carole and Harry Hughes (collectively, the Hugheses), a nursing home resident and her community spouse, appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS or the Ohio agency), holding that the Ohio agency properly penalized Mrs. Hughes based on Mr. Hughes\u2019s purchase of an annuity for himself with funds from his IRA account. The district court held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) precluded the transfer of assets because it exceeded Mr. Hughes\u2019s community spouse resource allowance (CSRA). Because the transfer occurred before the Ohio agency determined that Mrs. Hughes was eligible for Medicaid coverage and \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) permits an unlimited transfer of assets \u201cto another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse,\u201d we REVERSE.\nI.\nA.\nCongress established the Medicaid program in 1965 to provide federal and state funding of medical care for individuals who cannot afford to cover their own medical costs. See Social Security Amendments of 1965, Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, Pub.L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286, 343-52 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396w-5); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980). The program is administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS or the federal agency), who in turn exercises her authority through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). To implement the program, \u201c[e]ach participating State develops a plan containing reasonable standards ... for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance within boundaries set by the Medicaid statute[s] and the Secretary of [HHS].\u201d Wis. Dep\u2019t of Health & Family Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U.S. 473, 479, 122 S.Ct. 962, 151 L.Ed.2d 935 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(17).\nIn 1988, Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA), Pub.L. No. 100-360, 102 Stat. 683, \u201cto protect community spouses from \u2018pauperi-zation\u2019 while preventing financially secure couples from obtaining Medicaid assistance. To achieve this aim, Congress installed a set of intricate and interlocking requirements with which States must comply in allocating a couple\u2019s income and resources.\u201d Blumer, 534 U.S. at 480, 122 S.Ct. 962 (internal citation and parenthetical omitted). In particular, the MCCA allows the community spouse to keep a portion of the couple\u2019s assets \u2014 the CSRA \u2014 without affecting the institutionalized spouse\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2), (f)(2)(A). As the first step in determining the CSRA, the total of all the couple\u2019s resources is calculated as of the time the institutionalized spouse\u2019s institutionalization began; half of that total is allocated to each spouse (the spousal share). Id. \u00a7 1396r-5(e)(1)(A). Once the spousal share is determined, the CSRA is calculated by measuring the spousal share allocated to the community spouse against a statutory formula, which is further defined under each state plan, and subject to a ceiling and floor indexed for inflation. Id. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2)(B), (f)(2), (g).\n\u201cThe CSRA is considered unavailable to the institutionalized spouse in the eligibility determination, but all resources above the CSRA (excluding a small sum set aside as a personal allowance for the institutionalized spouse ...) must be spent before eligibility can be achieved.\u201d Blumer, 534 U.S. at 482-83, 122 S.Ct. 962 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r\u20145(c)(2)). However, a community spouse\u2019s income is not considered available to the institutionalized spouse for eligibility purposes, except in limited circumstances. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(b). Moreover, \u201cafter the month in which an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for benefits ..., no resources of the community spouse shall be deemed available to the institutionalized spouse.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(4).\nB.\nA state plan must \u201ccomply with the provisions of [\u00a7 ] 1396p ... with respect to liens, adjustments and recoveries of medical assistance correctly paid,[ ] transfers of assets, and treatment of certain trusts.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(18) (internal footnote omitted). Paragraph (1) of \u00a7 1396p(c) requires (in relevant part) that a state plan \u201cmust provide that if an institutionalized individual or the spouse of such an individual ... disposes of assets for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date\u201d (which, as relevant here, is defined as thirty-six months prior to the first date on which the institutionalized spouse applies for Medicaid assistance), \u201cthe individual is ineligible for medical assistance for services\u201d (such as coverage for nursing home costs) for the numbers of months that the assets would have covered the average monthly cost of such services. Id. \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(A); see id. \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(B)(i)-(ii), (C)(i)(I), (D)(ii), (E)(i).\nIn other words, even if the institutionalized spouse is eligible for Medicaid coverage after spending down her assets, \u00a7 1396p(c) requires a state to impose a transfer penalty (a period of restricted coverage) if either spouse disposed of assets for less than fair market value during the look-back period. However, the transfer penalties under paragraph (1) do not apply in certain circumstances. As relevant here: \u201cAn individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of paragraph (1) to the extent that ... (B) the assets [ ](i) were transferred to the individual\u2019s spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i). Congress amended \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B) to its current form in 1993. See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, Pub.L. No. 103-66, \u00a7 13611(a)(2), 107 Stat. 312; MCCA of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-360, \u00a7 303(b), 102 Stat. 683.\nCongress later passed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), Pub.L. No. 109-171, 120 Stat. 4, 62-64, as amended by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922, 2998, which added provisions to paragraph (1) concerning whether the purchase of certain annuities should be deemed transfers for less than fair market value. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F), (G). Congress did not, however, amend \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B) with the DRA\u2019s enactment.\nII.\nA.\nMrs. Hughes entered a nursing home in 2005. For nearly four years, Mr. Hughes paid for his wife\u2019s nursing home costs using the couple\u2019s resources, which largely consisted of funds from his IRA account. In June 2009, about three months before Mrs. Hughes applied for Medicaid coverage, Mr. Hughes purchased a $175,000 immediate single-premium annuity for himself using funds from his IRA account. The annuity guarantees monthly payments of $1,728.42 to Mr. Hughes from June 2009 to January 2019, totaling nine years and seven months, which is commensurate with Mr. Hughes\u2019s undisputed actuarial life expectancy. Combined with other retirement income, the annuity increased Mr. Hughes\u2019s monthly income to $3460.64 after the annuity took effect. In the event of Mr. Hughes\u2019s death, Mrs. Hughes is the first contingent beneficiary and the Ohio agency is \u201cthe remainder beneficiary for the total amount of medical assistance furnished to annuitant[\u2019s] spouse, [Mrs.] Hughes.\u201d\nMrs. Hughes applied for Medicaid coverage in September 2009. In December 2009, the Stark County division of the Ohio agency issued a notice that she was eligible for Medicaid as of the month of her application. However, the Ohio agency placed her on restricted coverage from September 2009 to June 2010, deeming her ineligible for coverage of nursing home costs for that time period because of Mr. Hughes\u2019s annuity purchase.\nThe Ohio agency determined that Mr. Hughes\u2019s annuity purchase was an improper transfer because he used a community resource (the IRA account) in an amount that exceeded his CSRA of $109,560 and because the annuity failed to name Ohio as the first contingent beneficiary. Thus, the Ohio agency placed Mrs. Hughes on restricted coverage for approximately ten months, the number of months that the difference between Mr. Hughes\u2019s CSRA and the annuity would have paid for nursing home costs. The Hugheses appealed the decision. The Ohio agency affirmed in a state-hearing and administrative-appeal level decision. State-court proceedings have been stayed pending this case\u2019s resolution.\nB.\nIn August 2010, the Hugheses filed this case under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Ohio agency violated the federal Medicaid statutes, including \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i), when it placed Mrs. Hughes on restricted coverage due to Mr. Hughes\u2019s purchase of an annuity with funds from his IRA account. They claimed, inter alia, that the Medicaid statutes grant them the right to purchase an actuarially-sound immediate single-premium annuity for the sole benefit of the community spouse.\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Ohio agency and denied the Hugheses\u2019 request for injunc-tive relief. See Hughes v. Colbert, 872 F.Supp.2d 612 (N.D.Ohio 2012). Notwithstanding the Hugheses\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) allows an institutionalized spouse to transfer unlimited assets to her community spouse without the transaction being considered an improper transfer, the court ruled that \u00a7 1396r\u20145(f)(1) precludes the transfer of assets to the community spouse that exceeds the CSRA and applies to the pre-eligibility transfer at issue here; and that \u00a7 1396r-5\u2019s supersession clause \u201crequires resolution of any inconsistency between [\u00a7 1396r \u2014 5(f)(1) ] and \u00a7 1396p(e)(2)(B) in the former clause\u2019s favor.\u201d Id. at 622-23. The Hugheses timely appealed.\nIII.\nA.\nWe review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, as well as its interpretation of federal statutes. Cnty. of Oakland v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 716 F.3d 935, 939 (6th Cir.2013). In reviewing questions of statutory interpretation, we employ a three-step framework:\n[F]irst, a natural reading of the full text; second, the common-law meaning of the statutory terms; and finally, consideration of the statutory and legislative history for guidance. The natural reading of the full text requires that we examine the statute for its plain meaning, including the language and design of the statute as a whole. If the statutory language is not clear, we may examine the relevant legislative history.\nElgharib v. Napolitano, 600 F.3d 597, 601 (6th Cir.2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo the extent that HHS has issued guidance on the federal Medicaid statutes in the form of opinion letters, an agency manual, and an amicus brief that lack the force of law, its statutory interpretations are not afforded deference under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), but \u201care \u2018entitled to respect\u2019 under ... Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), ... only to the extent that those interpretations have the \u2018power to persuade[.]\u2019 \u201d Christensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (internal citation altered); see In re Carter, 553 F.3d 979, 987-88 (6th Cir.2009) (applying Skidmore to the amicus brief filed by a federal agency charged with administering a statutory scheme); Caremark, Inc. v. Goetz, 480 F.3d 779, 787 (6th Cir.2007) (applying Skidmore to interpretations of Medicaid statutes set forth by CMS).\nB.\nThe primary issue on appeal is whether the transfer of a community resource to purchase an annuity for the community spouse\u2019s sole benefit, which transfer is done after the institutionalized spouse is institutionalized but before the institutionalized spouse\u2019s Medicaid eligibility is determined, can be deemed an improper transfer under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r \u2014 5(f)(1), even though \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) allows a transfer of assets \u201cto another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse.\u201d The district court accepted the Ohio agency\u2019s argument that a transfer of assets that exceeds the CSRA, even if made before the Ohio agency determined that Mrs. Hughes was eligible for Medicaid coverage, was improper under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) and that this provision supersedes \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) per the MCCA supersession clause, \u00a7 1396r-5(a)(1).\nWe reject the district court\u2019s approach. Section 1396r-5(f)(l) reads:\nAn institutionalized spouse may, without regard to section 1396p(c)(l) ..., transfer an amount equal to the community spouse resource allowance ..., but only to the extent the resources of the institutionalized spouse are transferred to (or for the sole benefit of) the community spouse. The transfer under the preceding sentence shall be made as soon as practicable after the date of the initial determination of eligibility....\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1).\nThe provision begins in permissive, not prohibitive, terms. The Ohio agency acknowledges that \u201cthe first sentence tells us that a transfer to the community spouse up to the CSRA is allowed.\u201d That same sentence states that such transfer is permitted notwithstanding \u00a7 1396p(c)(1), which governs transfer penalties. The next sentence provides that this permitted transfer \u201cshall be made as soon as practicable after the date of the initial determination of eligibility.\u201d (emphasis added). It does not say anything about a transfer made before the initial determination of eligibility, let alone that any pre-eligibility transfer that exceeds the CSRA is subject to a transfer penalty.\nTellingly, \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) is a CSRA provision. It does not appear within \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)\u2019s framework, which imposes restricted coverage for the disposal of assets for less than fair market value during the look-back period. Even assuming that \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) provides authority for a state to impose a period of ineligibility for a transfer that exceeds the CSRA, the statutory language and its relationship with \u00a7 1396p(c) do not support the Ohio agency\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1396r \u2014 5(f)(1) controls a transfer made before Medicaid eligibility is established. Thus, \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) does not supersede \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) for pre-eligibility transfers because there is no inconsistency between the provisions.\nOn this point, we join the Tenth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s holding: \u201cTo avoid rendering \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) superfluous, we agree that it and \u00a7 1396r \u2014 5(f)(1) must be read to operate at distinct temporal periods: one period during which unlimited spousal transfers are permitted, and one period during which transfers may not exceed the CSRA.\u201d Morris v. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., 685 F.3d 925, 935 (10th Cir.2012). When assets are transferred \u201cto the individual\u2019s spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i), before the institutionalized spouse is determined eligible for Medicaid coverage, \u201cthe unlimited transfer provision of \u00a7 1396p(c)(2) controls, and [a] transfer penalty [is] improper [under \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) ].\u201d Morris, 685 F.3d at 938.\nIn response to Morris\u2019s holding, the Ohio agency asks us to follow an unpublished district court opinion, Burkholder v. Lumpkin, No. 3:09-cv-1878, 2010 WL 522843 (N.D.Ohio Feb. 9, 2010). But Burkholder does not support its position because, in that case, the district court held that \u201c \u00a7 1396r-5(f) supersedes \u00a7 1396p(c)(2) where ... the transfer of assets from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse occurs after the initial eligibility determination.\u201d Id. at *7. By contrast, the Ohio agency seeks to impose a penalty for a transfer that occurred before it found Mrs. Hughes eligible for coverage.\nFurther, the two primary state-court cases the Ohio agency cites in support\u2014Feldman v. Department of Children & Families, 919 So.2d 512 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005), and McNamara v. Ohio Department of Human Services, 139 Ohio App.3d 551, 744 N.E.2d 1216 (2000) \u2014 are unpersuasive. Neither state-court decision engages in any meaningful analysis of the statutory text. Indeed, one commentator has noted that such rulings are \u201cinconsistent with statutory authority\u201d and based on \u201cantipathy\u201d toward alleged sheltering of assets. Eric M. Carlson, Long-Term Care Advocacy \u00a7 7.12(5)(e)(ii)(A) (Matthew Bender 2012). \u201cPolicy [rationales] cannot prevail over the text of a statute.\u201d Tran v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 937, 941 (6th Cir.2006).\nOur reading of the statute is supported by HHS\u2019s guidance. In its amicus brief, HHS explains that \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) \u201chas nothing to say about the inter-spousal transfers that are permissible before a determination of eligibility.\u201d The federal agency\u2019s State Medicaid Manual confirms that \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) applies to post-eligibility reallocation of resources and that \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) permits transfers to a third party for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse. See State Medicaid Manual \u00a7\u00a7 3258.11, 3262.4. HHS has taken the same position in a series of opinion letters issued to state plan administrators and to the public, reasoning that \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) does not conflict with, and thus does not supersede, \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B), as the two provisions apply to different situations, before and after eligibility is established; and that permitting inter-spousal transfers under \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B) does not render \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1) a nullity, as the latter provision still has meaning with respect to resource allocation after eligibility is established. We agree with amici curiae, the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys and the Ohio State Bar Association (who appear in support of the Hugheses), that HHS\u2019s view on this issue represents a \u201cwell thought out explanation of the differences between these two statutes\u201d and thus is due respect under Skidmore.\nThe Ohio agency argues that Congress intended a different result, one that would subordinate \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) to \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1)\u2019s CSRA transfer cap. But the statutory text does not provide any indication of such an intent for the reasons described. Moreover, the legislative history does not support the Ohio agency\u2019s contention. A Senate amendment to H.R. 2264 (the bill that ultimately became OBRA, which enacted \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i)) would have subjected the unlimited-transfer provision to \u00a7 1396r5(f)(1)\u2019s CSRA transfer cap. See 139 Cong. Rec. 7913-01, 7986 (1993) (bill passes the Senate with amendment); id. at 8013 (amending \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) to provide that \u201c(B) the resources-(1) were transferred to the individual\u2019s spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse and did not exceed the amount permitted under section 1921(f)(1)\u201d (emphasis added)). In a conference report, the House of Representatives receded from its disagreement with the Senate amendment, but nevertheless offered substitute language that dropped the reference to \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(l), and provided the current language of \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i), which was adopted. H.R. Rep. 103-213, at 1, 324 (1993) (Conf.Rep.), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1088. That Congress declined to adopt language supporting the very construction of \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) that the Ohio agency now advances is a \u201ccompelling\u201d indication of its intent not to subordinate \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) to \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1). INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 442-43,107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (\u201cFew principles of statutory construction are more compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nC.\nThe Ohio agency raises two alternate grounds for affirmance. To the extent it did not raise the issues before the district court, we address them to promote finality in this litigation, as the issues require no further factual development and have been sufficiently presented for our review. See In re Morris, 260 F.3d 654, 664 (6th Cir.2001).\n1. Section 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s sole-benefit rule\nThe Ohio agency argues that the transfer of a community resource to purchase an annuity by or on behalf of the community spouse cannot be \u201cfor the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse\u201d under \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) if \u2014 as here \u2014 the annuity designates the institutionalized spouse as the first contingent beneficiary and the Ohio agency as the second contingent beneficiary to receive payments in the event of the community spouse\u2019s early death, even if the annuity is actuarially sound and payments are made only to the spouse during his life. We disagree.\nThe statute does not define the term \u201csole benefit.\u201d Nor is the term defined by federal regulation. The Ohio agency\u2019s position on this issue rests primarily on the plain meaning of the word \u201csole,\u201d citing dictionaries and other authorities for the proposition that the word means \u201c \u2018only,\u2019 \u2018solitary,\u2019 \u2018single\u2019 or \u2018exclusive.\u2019 \u201d But what a dictionary does not tell us is whether a transfer of assets \u201cto another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse\u201d means (as HHS contends in its amicus brief and the Hugheses contend in their second supplemental brief) that the transfer may benefit only the spouse during his life but may include contingent beneficiaries, so long as the financial instrument is actuarially sound and payments are made only to the spouse during his life; or (as the Ohio agency contends) that the transfer may benefit only the spouse at the time of the transfer and also thereafter, such that any remaining assets in the event of the spouse\u2019s early death cannot pass to a contingent beneficiary. Cf. Sanford J. Schlesinger and Barbara J. Schemer, Medicaid After OBRA '93, 21 Est. Plan. 74, 76 (1994) (opining that it is an open question whether, under the sole-benefit rule, \u201ca trust for the sole benefit of the spouse for life, with the remainder to someone else, [would] be a trust for the sole benefit of the spouse\u201d).\nThe Ohio agency argues that HHS\u2019s position on this issue is inconsistent. The State Medicaid Manual, \u00a7 3258.11, explains:\nThe exception for transfers to a third party for the sole benefit of the spouse may have greater impact on eligibility because resources may potentially be placed beyond the reach of either spouse and thus not be counted for eligibility purposes. However, for the exception to be applicable, the definition of what is for the sole benefit of the spouse (see \u00a7 3257) must be fully met. This definition is fairly restrictive, in that it requires that any funds transferred be spent for the benefit of the spouse within a time-frame actuarially commensurate with the spouse\u2019s life expectancy. If this requirement is not met, the exemption is void, and a transfer to a third party may then be subject to a transfer penalty.\nIn turn, \u00a7 3257 of the manual states:\nA transfer is considered to be for the sole benefit of a spouse, blind or disabled child, or a disabled individual if the transfer is arranged in such a way that no individual or entity except the spouse, blind or disabled child, or disabled individual can benefit from the assets transferred in any way, whether at the time of the transfer or at any time in the future.\nId. \u00a7 3257.\nAlthough the phrase \u201cat any time in the future\u201d might be interpreted to mean that contingent beneficiaries cannot be named in the financial instrument, this is not the federal agency\u2019s position. As HHS has reasoned in its amicus brief and in a prior opinion letter, the designation of contingent beneficiaries to receive funds remaining in an annuity in the event of the spouse\u2019s early death would not necessarily violate the sole-benefit rule, so long as the annuity is actuarially sound and provides for payments only to the spouse during his life. Accord Mertz v. Houstoun, 155 F.Supp.2d 415, 426 n. 14 (E.D.Pa.2001) (\u201cIf an annuitant receives the amount invested [plus interest] during his lifetime, the annuity is actuarially sound and for his sole benefit.\u201d).\nHHS\u2019s position is mirrored by Ohio\u2019s implementing regulation:\nA transfer for the sole benefit of the spouse, blind or disabled child or disabled individual in which there is a provision within the trust, contract or other binding instrument to expend all of the transferred resources [for the benefit of the individual during that individual\u2019s life expectancy] may provide for other beneficiaries.\nOhio Admin. Code \u00a7 5101:1-39-07(F)(1).\nThe Ohio agency asserts that HHS\u2019s position and its state\u2019s regulation are wrong. But if we were to adopt the Ohio agency\u2019s definition of sole benefit, it is difficult to conceive what type of financial arrangement could meet it. Under the definition urged by the Ohio agency, it acknowledges that, \u201cuniversally, ... it seems that no annuity (or at least no typical annuity) could meet this [definition] because it seems to be typical that an annuity instrument names at least one [contingent] beneficiary.\u201d We take its reasoning two steps further. Even if an annuity or another financial arrangement does not designate a contingent beneficiary, or even if the arrangement (such as a pure life annuity) expressly provides that payments shall terminate upon the spouse\u2019s death, someone other than the spouse will benefit. In the first scenario, the presence of contingent beneficiaries is a certainty under the law whether the beneficiaries are designated in the financial instrument, in the spouse\u2019s will, or by the Ohio statute of descent and distribution, Ohio Rev.Code. \u00a7 2105.06. In the second scenario, the entity that issued the financial product will benefit upon forfeiture of future payment.\nWere we to adopt the Ohio agency\u2019s definition, no transfer \u201cto another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse\u201d under most standard financial arrangements could satisfy \u00a7 1396p(e)(2)(B)(i). We reject this \u201cacontextual approach to statutory interpretation.\u201d Flores v. Rios, 36 F.3d 507, 513 (6th Cir.1994); see Davis v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (\u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d).\nWe cannot presume that Congress operated in a vacuum when it enacted \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i). By providing that a couple may transfer assets \u201cto another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spouse,\u201d the term \u201canother\u201d is not limiting. It naturally encompasses standard financial arrangements (such as an annuity) crafted for the spouse\u2019s sole benefit during his life. Our reading is supported by HHS, which takes the position that the term \u201canother\u201d includes an entity that issues the annuity. In this context, HHS\u2019s construction of the sole-benefit rule gives the statute meaning. The actuarial-soundness requirement reasonably assures that the assets were transferred to a third party for the individual spouse\u2019s sole benefit. Any contingent interest becomes relevant only if the spouse dies early. To extend the sole-benefit requirement past a spouse\u2019s death is nonsensical. The federal agency\u2019s construction is reasonable, supported by the statutory structure, and, thus, due respect under Skidmore.\n2. Whether an annuity that satisfies \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s sole-benefit rule must also satisfy the annuity rules under \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F)\nThe Ohio agency argues the transfer of a community resource to purchase an annuity by or on behalf of the community spouse that satisfies \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s sole-benefit rule must also satisfy the annuity rules under \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F), and that because Mr. Hughes\u2019s annuity does not name Ohio as \u201cthe remainder beneficiary in the first position,\u201d it fails to satisfy \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F). However, its reading of the two provisions defies the text and structure of the statute.\nAs the Hugheses correctly contend in their second supplemental brief, an annuity that satisfies \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) need not satisfy \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F). The annuity rules under \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) fall within \u00a7 1396p(e)(1)\u2019s (paragraph (1)) overall transfer-penalty regime: \u25a0\n\u201cFor purposes of this paragraph, the purchase of an annuity shall be treated as the disposal of an asset for less than , fair market value unless' \u2014 \u2022\n(i) the State is named as the remainder beneficiary in the first position for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the institutionalized individual under this sub-chapter; or\n(ii) the State is named as such a beneficiary in the second position after the community spouse or minor or disabled child and is named in the first position if such spouse or a representative of such child disposes of any such remainder for less than fair market value.\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) (emphasis added). On the other hand, \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) is an exception to transfer penalties under paragraph (1):\nAn individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of paragraph (1) to the extent that \u2014 (B) the assets \u2014 -(i) were transferred to the indi-viduaFs spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual\u2019s spousef.]\nId. \u00a7 1396p(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).\nIn its amicus brief, HHS takes the position that an annuity that satisfies \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s sole-benefit rule must also satisfy \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F). It does so without any reference to the statutory text, meaningful analysis, or reference to authority. The only proffered support for HHS\u2019s position is a 2006 CMS letter enclosure concerning the treatment of annuities under the DRA. In that letter, the federal agency reasoned:\nUnlike the new section 1917(c)(1)(G) [] added by section 6012(c) of the DRA ..., section 1917(c)(1)(F) does not restrict application of its requirements only to an annuity purchased by or on behalf of an annuitant who has applied for medical assistance for nursing facility or other long-term care services. Therefore, we interpret section 1917(c)(1)(F) as applying to annuities purchased by an applicant or by a spouse, or to transactions made by the applicant or spouse.\nCMS, Changes in Medicaid Annuity Rules under the DRA of 2005 \u00a7 II.B (July 27, 2006).\nAs the Ohio agency acknowledges, HHS applies \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) to an annuity that otherwise satisfies \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) without acknowledging or addressing the structure of \u00a7 1396p(c), which places \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) within paragraph (1)\u2019s transfer-penalty framework and specifically sets forth \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s sole-benefit rule as an exception to paragraph (1). HHS\u2019s rationale lacks reasoning and contravenes the plain language of \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1396p(e)(1)(F). Thus, we decline to afford its interpretation respect under Skidmore. See Flores v. USCIS, 718 F.3d 548, 554-55 (6th Cir.2013).\nRather than adopt HHS\u2019s rationale, the Ohio agency asks us to hold that Congress could not have enacted \u00a7 1396p(e)(1)(F) without intending it to supplement the earlier and more general provision of \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i).\nWe disagree with the Ohio agency\u2019s characterization of the two provisions. Although \u201cit is axiomatic that a general provision yields to a specific provision when there is a conflict,\u201d Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. of Louisville v. LFG, LLC, 460 F.3d 697, 716 (6th Cir.2006), there is no inherent conflict between the two provisions, and each provision is specific in its own way. Section 1396p(c)(1)(F) purports to govern all annuities through the imposition of a transfer penalty under paragraph (1) if the annuity does not satisfy certain rules. On the other hand, \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) carves out an exception to paragraph (l)\u2019s transfer penalties. The language of \u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(F) limits its annuity rules \u201c[f]or purposes of this paragraph.\u201d The language of \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) provides that \u201c[a]n individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of paragraph (1)\u201d if a transfer satisfies, in relevant part, the sole-benefit rule. The two provisions complement rather than contradict one another. Section 1396p(c)(1)(F) is not rendered illusory. It applies to all annuities not excepted by another provision such as \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B), including annuities benefiting non-exempt children or a spousal annuity that is not actuarially sound.\nBecause the provisions are not in conflict, that Congress enacted \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) after \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) does not support a finding that \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) must give way to the newer provision, \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F). See United States v. Clay, 982 F.2d 959, 963 (6th Cir.1993) (\u201cWhen interpreting the effect of a new law upon an old one, \u2018 [o]nly a clear repugnancy between the old law and the new results in the former giving way and then only pro tanto to the extent of the repugnancy.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Georgia v. Penn. R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 457, 65 S.Ct. 716, 89 L.Ed. 1051 (1945))).\nLast, the Ohio agency\u2019s reference to floor statements by members of Congress \u2014 indicating in general terms that the DRA was enacted to close loopholes related to the purchase of annuities \u2014 is unavailing given that the statutory language unambiguously limits \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) to paragraph (1) and \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) is an exception to paragraph (l)\u2019s transfer penalties and was unamended by the DRA. See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 457 n. 15, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002) (noting that floor statements cannot override clear statutory text); Conn. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (\u201cWe have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). If Congress prefers the interpretation that applies \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) notwithstanding \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i), it need only amend the statute.\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n. Since this case\u2019s inception, ODJFS has been reorganized. The duties and legal responsibilities of the director of ODJFS have been transferred to the state Medicaid director. See Am. Sub. H.B. No. 59, 2013 Ohio Laws 25 (provisions to be codified). In this opinion, we refer to the state Medicaid agency as the Ohio agency.\n. This provision reads:\nAn institutionalized spouse may, without regard to section 1396p(c)(l) ..., transfer an amount equal to the community spouse resource allowance ..., but only to the extent the resources of the institutionalized spouse are transferred to (or for the sole benefit of) the community spouse. The transfer under the preceding sentence shall be made as soon as practicable after the date of the initial determination of eligibility....\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r \u2014 5(f)(1).\n. Until 2001, CMS was known as the Health Care Financing Administration. See CMS; State of Organization, Functions and Delegations of Authority; Reorganization Order, 66 Fed.Reg. 35437-03 (July 5, 2001).\n. As relevant here, the term \u2018'institutionalized spouse\u201d means an individual who is in a nursing facility and is married to a spouse who is not in a nursing facility. The term \"community spouse\u201d means the spouse of an institutionalized spouse. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5(h)(1) \u2014 (2).\n. The Hugheses were originally joined by another couple as plaintiffs, who are no longer parties to this action.\n. An annuity is actuarially sound where the entire expected return from the annuity is commensurate with a reasonable estimate of the annuitant's expected lifetime, as determined by the actuarial tables published by the Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration. See State Medicaid Manual \u00a7 3258.9(B).\n. The district court rejected the Ohio agency's argument that the court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this case pursuant to the Younger abstention doctrine, and ruled that the Medicaid statutes cited by the Hugheses conferred enforceable rights under \u00a7 1983. The Ohio agency does not contest these rulings, and neither issue affects our jurisdiction. Further, the Hugheses do not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of their equal protection claim or their claim that certain Ohio Medicaid regulations are preempted by Federal law. We deem these issues abandoned.\n. The Ohio agency concedes that Mr. Hughes\u2019s annuity was not a countable resource in determining his wife\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. Indeed, the Ohio agency determined that Mrs. Hughes was eligible for Medicaid, but placed her on restricted coverage because it deemed improper the transfer of funds from Mr. Hughes's IRA account to purchase the annuity. Thus, we need not decide the question whether the annuity may be considered a countable resource in the initial eligibility determination. See Lopes v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., 696 F.3d 180, 188 (2d Cir.2012) (holding that the payment stream from a non-assignable annuity is not a resource for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility); Morris v. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., 685 F.3d 925, 932-33 & n. 5 (10th Cir.2012) (collecting case-law).\n. \"A State ... may not provide for any period of ineligibility for an individual due to transfer of resources for less than fair market value except in accordance with this subsection [(i.e., \u00a7 1396p(c)) ].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c)(4). The provisions therein do not expressly include penalties for a transfer that exceeds the CSRA.\n. The Supreme Court also has referenced \u00a7 1396r \u2014 5(f)(1) with a post-eligibility understanding. See Blumer, 534 U.S. at 482 n. 5, 122 S.Ct 962.\n. Unlike this case, the at-issue financial product in McNamara was an \"annuitized\u201d trust rather than a standard commercial annuity. See 744 N.E.2d at 1221.\n. As another source of guidance, the Social Security Administration \u2014 in setting forth its policy that a special needs trust must be for the sole benefit of the designated individual\u2014 has defined the term to mean that the trust must benefit no one but that individual, \u201cwhether at the time the trust is established or at any time for the remainder of the individual's life.\u201d Social Security Program Operations Manual System (POMS), SI 011120.201(F)(2).\n. The Ohio agency does not dispute that Mr. Hughes's annuity would satisfy \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) if it named Ohio as the first contingent beneficiary for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the institutionalized spouse and Mrs. Hughes as the second contingent beneficiary. To the extent the transfer here (based on Mr. Hughes\u2019s purchase of an annuity) is not for fair market value under \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F), it is because of the contingent remainder interest held by the institutionalized spouse, the value of which was not transferred because it is retained by her.\n. The provision provides:\n(G) For purposes of this paragraph with respect to a transfer of assets, the term \"assets\u201d includes an annuity purchased by or on behalf of an annuitant who has applied for medical assistance with respect to nursing facility services or other long-term care services under this subchapter unless\u2014\n(i) the annuity is \u2014 (I) an annuity described in subsection (b) or (q) of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [Title 26, U.S.C.A.]; or (II) purchased with proceeds from \u2014 (aa) an account or trust described in subsection (a), (c), or (p) of section 408 of such Code; (bb) a simplified employee pension (within the meaning of section 408(k) of such Code); or (cc) a Roth IRA described in section 408A of such Code; or\n(ii) the annuity \u2014 (I) is irrevocable and nonassignable; (II) is actuarially sound (as determined in accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration); and (III) provides for payments in equal amounts during the term of the annuity, with no deferral and no balloon payments made.\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(G) (internal paragraph formatting altered). We need not address the Hugheses\u2019 argument that the annuity is saved by \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(G) given our disposition of this appeal on other grounds.\n. With respect to annuity disclosures, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(e)(1) provides that the Medicaid application must include \"a statement that under paragraph (2) the State becomes a remainder beneficiary under such an annuity or similar financial instrument by virtue of the provision of such medical assistance.\u201d The referenced \u201cparagraph 2\u201d of subsection (e) limits itself to annuities that are subject to \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F)'s annuity rules (such as naming the state as the remainder beneficiary). See id. \u00a7 1396p(e)(2)(A) (\"In the case of disclosure concerning an annuity under subsection (c)(1)(F) of this section, the State shall notify the issuer of the annuity of the right of the State under such subsection as a preferred remainder beneficiaiy in the annuity for medical assistance furnished to the individual.\u201d). Thus, subsection (e) reenforces the conclusion that \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F) does not control all annuities.\n. In any event, such referenced statements do not reveal Congressional intent to subject \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B)(i) to \u00a7 1396p(c)(1)(F)'s annuity rules.",
