        "text": "PER CURIAM.\nThese cases, motions of which were argued in tandem and decided on October 31, 2013, and which concern the so-called \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policies of the New York City Police Department, have, quite apart from the underlying merits, raised a number of unusual procedural issues. In a separate opinion published contemporaneously with this one, we explain the basis of our prior, brief order reassigning these cases from Judge Shira A. Scheindlin to a new district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to be chosen randomly. In this opinion, we address the unprecedented motion filed by Judge Scheindlin herself, through counsel, to appear and seek reconsideration of our order of reassignment. The motion, submitted substantially in the form of a brief in favor of reconsideration, presents the threshold question whether, in the circumstances presented, a district judge may participate as a party, as an intervenor, or as an amicus curiae in an appeal of her decisions. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY Judge Scheind-lin\u2019s motion to appear in this Court in support of retaining authority over these cases.\nBackground\nThese cases deal with the constitutionality of certain practices of the New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d). The practices \u2014 and these cases themselves\u2014 present issues of prominent public concern and have attracted intense scrutiny in the media. On August 12, 2013, following a nine-week trial in Floyd v. City of New York, Judge Scheindlin held that the City of New York (the \u201cCity\u201d) violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by acting with deliberate indifference towards the NYPD\u2019s practice of unconstitutional stops and unconstitutional frisks and by adopting a policy of \u201cindirect racial profiling\u201d that targeted racially defined groups for \u201cstops-and-frisks.\u201d Judge Scheindlin also ordered an array of injunctive remedies, including but not limited to the appointment of a monitor, the institution of a program requiring certain officers to wear cameras on their persons, and the amendment of the forms used to document stop- and-frisks.\nAfter some delay, the City sought, in the District Court, to stay those remedies until a decision on the merits had been reached by the Court of Appeals in the normal course. Judge Scheindlin denied that motion and, as is the normal practice, the City renewed its request for a stay in this Court. We held extended oral argument and, on October 31, 2013, granted the motion for a stay during the pendency of the appeals and, based on the record of the proceedings in the District Court and Judge Scheindlin\u2019s participation in media interviews, reassigned the cases to a different district judge, to be chosen randomly, in order to avoid the appearance of partiality.\nOn November 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin moved in this court, through counsel, for \u201cleave in the nature of an order under Rule 21(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure governing mandamus proceedings providing for appellate review of motions for judicial disqualification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, authorizing counsel to appear on behalf of the District Judge in order to address the factual and legal sufficiency of the Motion Panel\u2019s sua sponte order of removal.\u201d On November 9, 2013, Judge Scheindlin\u2019s counsel, n\u00f3w styling himself as amicus curiae on her behalf, filed a letter urging us to vacate our order of reassignment \u201cto terminate a dispute that is distracting attention from the underlying merits.\u201d\nDiscussion\nWe conclude that Judge Scheindlin\u2019s motion lacks a procedural basis. As explained more fully in our separate opinion concerning the merits of the order of reassignment, the cases were reassigned not because of any judicial misconduct or ethical lapse on the part of Judge Scheindlin \u2014 as to which we have expressly made no finding \u2014 but solely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Section 455(a) provides that \u201c[a]ny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify [herjself in any proceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d We know of no procedural mechanism that might permit a district judge to come before us and argue on her own behalf in these circumstances, nor has Judge Scheindlin identified one.\nIndeed, we note in the motion itself some inconsistency in its theory of Judge Scheindlin\u2019s relationship to the proceedings in this Court. The motion requests leave for her lawyers \u201cto appear either as counsel to the District Judge, or as amici curiae' on her behalf.\u201d Additionally, the motion purports to seek relief \u201cin the nature of an order under Rule 21(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d This locution is notable because Rule 21 governs \u201cWrits of Mandamus and Prohibition, and Other Extraordinary Writs,\u201d and provides that the \u201ctrial-court judge may request permission to address the petition [for mandamus] but may not do so unless invited or ordered to do so by the court of appeals.\u201d\nRule 21, however, does not apply to these proceedings because there has been no petition for a writ of mandamus or any other type of extraordinary writ in these cases. The Supreme Court has long instructed that the writ of mandamus is \u201ca \u2018drastic and extraordinary\u2019 remedy \u2018reserved for really extraordinary causes.\u2019 \u201d No writ of mandamus is involved in this appeal: We have not issued an extraordinary writ to the district judge, nor is there a petition for a writ directed to us. For this reason, the case presented here is quite unlike those in which other district judges have appeared before this court pursuant to specific statutory authority. Outside of the context of a writ of mandamus, it is procedurally improper for a District Judge to enter an appearance in an appeal of her own decisions, whether as a party, intervenor, or amicus.\nWe know of no precedent suggesting that a district judge has standing before an appellate court to protest reassignment of a case. While a district judge may believe that he or she has expended a great deal of effort and energy on a case, only to see it reassigned, reassignment is not a legal injury to the district judge. Rather, reassignment allows the courts to ensure that cases are decided by judges without even an appearance of partiality. A district judge has no legal interest in a case or its outcome, and, consequently, suffers no legal injury by reassignment.\nTo the extent that Judge Scheindlin seeks to defend herself against the suggestion of violation of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, our accompanying opinion explains that we have made no findings that Judge Scheindlin has committed judicial misconduct, nor have we suggested that she has abdicated any of her ethical responsibilities. Rather, we have simply concluded that the appearance of her impartiality might reasonably be questioned. We therefore need not consider Judge Scheindlin\u2019s argument that she ought to be afforded an opportunity to contest charges of judicial misconduct.\nFinally, we note that Judge Scheindlin\u2019s counsel, now purporting to serve as ami-cus \u201cto the district judge,\u201d filed a supplemental letter on November 9, 2013, wherein he urges that we vacate parts of our order of October 31, 2013, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d which would \u201cpermit the parties to raise the issues\u201d without \u201cbeing forced to address them in the context of an unseemly dispute among judges\u201d and in a way that would \u201cterminate a dispute that is distracting attention from the underlying merits.\u201d First, we cannot subscribe to the view that a decision of this Court\u2014 made pursuant to a statute passed by Congress \u2014 should be vacated because a non-party (even a judge) claiming to be affected by that order believes that the issue has become controversial or \u201cdistracting.\u201d\nSecond, as we observe in our accompanying opinion, reassignment is an ordinary tool used by our judicial system to maintain and promote the appearance of impartiality across the federal courts. We recognize that it is frustrating to work extensively on a case that is later reassigned, and that reassignment, even if only based on an appearance of partiality, is a displeasing occurrence for any district judge, particularly for a long-serving and distinguished one such as Judge Scheindlin, but we are confident that these matters will be ably handled, without any arguable appearance of partiality, by another of her capable colleagues.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we DENY Judge Scheindlin\u2019s motion to appear in this Court in support of retaining authority over these cases.\n.In this section, we recite only the facts directly relevant to this opinion. A more complete history of these cases may be found in our separate opinion published today, addressing the merits of reassigning the cases to a new district judge.\n. See Floyd v. City of New York,-F.Supp.2d -, No. 08-cv-1034, 2013 WL 4046209, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2013).\n. See Floyd v. City of New York,-F.Supp.2d -, Nos. 08-cv-1034, 12-cv-2274, 2013 WL 4046217 (S.D.N.Y.

Attorney Burt Neu-borne is the only person to have actually entered an appearance on Judge Scheindlin\u2019s behalf. See Local Rule 12.3(b) (\"An attorney, other than the initial counsel of record, who appears in a case in any capacity on behalf of a party or an amicus curiae must file the Notice of Appearance Form for Substitute, Additional, or Amicus Counsel at the time the attorney enters the case.\u201d). We do observe, however, that, pursuant to Local Rule 29.1(a), we \"ordinarily will deny leave to file an ami-cus brief when, by reason of a relationship between a judge assigned to hear the proceeding and the amicus curiae or its counsel, the filing of the brief might cause the recusal of the judge.\u201d Mr. Neuborne labors under no such disability.\n. See Note 14, post, for the full text of this letter.\n. Scheindlin Mot., at \u00b6 46.\n. Id. at 2 (emphasis added). Judge Scheind-lin asserts several other legal bases for her motion, none of which in our view supports, or even suggests, a district judge's right to formally contest reassignment. In addition to Rule 21, her motion \"is brought'pursuant to Rules ... 27, and 29 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106'; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (the All Writs Act); and the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Scheindlin Mot. at 2. Rule 27 (governing \"Motions\u201d) and Rule 29 (governing \"Brief of an Amicus Curiae\u201d) are general provisions that do not provide a procedural predicate for her unprecedented motion. Similarly, Section 2106 of Title 28, entitled \"Determination,\u201d states that \"[t]he Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\u201d While this provision establishes what an appellate court may do, it does not speak to a district judge's role in that process. The All Writs Act gives courts the authority to \"issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Although we have recognized numerous injunctions and orders of a district court appropriately authorized under the All Writs Act, we are aware of no precedent that establishes a district judge's right to join an ongoing proceeding by formally contesting an appellate court\u2019s order of reassignment. Finally, the constitutional amendments on which she relies are also inapplicable. The freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment does not mean that there can be no limitations, such as those contemplated under section 455(a), on what a federal judge may say, much less on where she can say it, especially as it relates to pending litigation. As discussed in our accompanying opinion, numerous courts of appeals have reassigned cases due to an appearance of partiality that was traceable to speech by a district judge. Similarly, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is inapplicable in these circumstances, because reassignment of a case is not a legal injury to the district judge, and we have made no finding of judicial misconduct that a judge might have the right to contest.\n.

Court for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (quoting Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 259-60, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041 (1947)); see also In re The City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 932-33 (2d Cir.2010) (enumerating requirements for the writ).\n. See Fed. R.App. P. 21; see, e.g., U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Citigroup Global Mkts. Inc., 673 F.3d 158, 169 (2d Cir.2012) (appointing counsel to represent Judge Jed S. Rakoff in a mandamus proceeding); In re Austrian & German Holocaust Litig., 250 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2001) (acknowledging that the Second Circuit properly invited Judge Shirley Kram to respond through counsel to mandamus petitions).\n. In somewhat similar circumstances, the then-Chief Judge of the Central District of California, Manuel L. Real, refused to reassign, pursuant to mandate of the Ninth Circuit, a case over which he had been presiding. Instead, he directed the parties to brief whether the Ninth Circuit had the power to reassign cases. See Brown v. Baden, 815 F.2d 575, 576 (9th Cir.1987). The Ninth Circuit then issued a writ of mandamus requiring reassignment, explaining that \"[t]here is no doubt as to our authority to order a case reassigned\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the scheme of the federal judicial system, the district court is required to follow and implement our decisions just as we are oath- and duty-bound to follow the decisions and mandates of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Id. at 576. Chief Judge Real then petitioned for a writ of certiorari to appeal the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court, which the Supreme Court denied without comment. See Real v. Yagman, 484 U.S. 963, 108 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed.2d 390 (1987).\n. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a); see also In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955) (\"[T]o perform its high function in the best way justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Londono, 100 F.3d 236, 242 (2d Cir.1996) (\"[Rjeassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)) (abrogated on other grounds).\n.
