        "text": "OPINION\nGRABER, Circuit Judge:\nPetitioner Roberto Solorio-Ruiz, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of a final order of removal. Petitioner stands convicted of carjacking in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 215(a). An immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) ruled that Petitioner\u2019s crime of conviction is an aggravated felony, making him ineligible for relief from removal, because (1) the carjacking offense is a crime of violence, and (2) the carjacking offense is a theft offense. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed on the first ground and did not reach the second. We review de novo whether a particular conviction under state law counts as a removable offense. Arellano Hernandez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 1127, 1130 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 2180, 198 L.Ed.2d 232 (2017). For the reasons that follow, we hold that a California conviction under section 215(a) does not qualify as a- crime of violence. We grant the petition to that extent and remand the case to the BIA to decide, in the first instance, whether Petitioner\u2019s offense qualifies as a theft offense.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nIn 1995, a California jury convicted Petitioner of carjacking in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 215(a), and evading a police officer in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2. Petitioner was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on the carjacking charge and to one year and four months on the evading charge, plus enhancements that made the total sentence of confinement 21 years and four months. Thereafter, the government sought to remove Petitioner on the ground that the carjacking conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The government advanced two theories: that Petitioner committed a. \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), and that, he committed a \u201ctheft offense,\u201d id. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G)..\nAfter a series of proceedings concerning Petitioner\u2019s representation and citizenship status, the details of which are not relevant to the issues before us, the IJ ruled that Petitioner is removable. But the IJ continued the hearing to allow Petitioner to file an application for relief from removal. Petitioner submitted an application for relief under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (\u201c\u00a7 212(c) waiver\u201d), which was available to lawful permanent residents who had been lawfully domiciled in the United States for seven consecutive years. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (holding that a \u00a7 212(c) waiver remains available in certain circumstances); In re Abdelghany, 26 I. & N. Dec. 254 (B.I.A. 2014) (discussing eligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver).\nThe government then moved- to preter-mit the application,-'arguing that Petitioner was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. A \u00a7 212(c) waiver is not available if the applicant serv\u00e9d an aggregate of more than five years of imprisonment for an aggravated felony. Petitioner concededly served a sentence of more' than five years for the carjacking offense, but he disputed the government\u2019s contention that carjacking qualifies .as an aggravated felony. The IJ granted the government\u2019s motion on the ground that the carjacking statute qualified as a crime of violence and as a theft offense.\nPetitioner timely appealed to the BIA. He challenged both categorizations of his conviction. The BIA held that the carjacking offense is a crime of violence and dismissed the appeal on that ground. The BIA did not reach the question whether the crime of conviction qualifies as a theft offense. Petitioner timely sought review in this court.\nDISCUSSION\nA. Crime of Violence\nWe must begin with Nieves-Medrano v. Holder, 590 F.3d 1057, 1058 (9th Cir. 2010) (order), which squarely held that \u201ca conviction for carjacking under California Penal Code \u00a7 215 is categorically a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\u201d If Nieves-Medrano remains good law, that is both the beginning and the end of the case.\nBut we are bound by \u201cintervening higher authority\u201d; if a later, controlling authority is \u201cclearly irreconcilable\u201d with our earlier precedent, we \u201cshould reject the prior circuit opinion as having been effectively overruled.\u201d Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 893 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). In 2010, the United States Supreme Court issued Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), which held that the physical force that a crime of violence entails must be \u201cviolent force\u2014that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d Johnson altered our understanding of how violent a crime must be to qualify as a crime of violence. See United States v. Geozos, 870 F.3d 890, 901 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding, directly contrary to a -pre-John-son memorandum disposition in the same case, that a robbery conviction under section 812.13(1) of the Florida Statutes did not, under Johnson, categorically qualify as a violent felony).\nNieves-Medrana cannot stand in light of Johnson. In Nieves-Medrano, we said nothing about the level of violence required to violate California Penal Code \u00a7 215(a). Instead, we rested our decision entirely on United States v. Becerril-Lopez, 541 F.3d 881, 893 (9th Cir. 2008), in which we held that robbery under section 211 was categorically a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Nieves-Medrano, 590 F.3d at 1057-58. Becerril-Lopez, too, lacks an analysis of the level of violence required to commit California robbery. Thus, neither Nieves-Medrano nor the sole case on which it relied demonstrates that we considered, at all, whether section 215(a) requires the use of violent force. Johnson\u2014and the violence requirement that it announced\u2014thus fatally undermined our decision in Nieves-Medrano, and we must consider anew whether California carjacking, after Johnson, qualifies as a crime of violence. See United States v. Molinar, 876 F.3d 953, 958 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that Johnson \u201ceffectively overruled\u201d our decision in United States v. Taylor, 529 F.3d 1232 (9th Cir. 2008), by changing the crime-of-violence analysis); United States v. Flores-Cordero, 723 F.3d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir. 2013) (\u201cWe must now [after Johnson] conclude that conviction of \u2018resisting arrest\u2019 under Arizona law is not categorically a crime of violence within the meaning of federal law, and that our decision in Estrada-Rodriguez[ v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 517 (9th Cir. 2007)], to the extent it suggests otherwise, has been superseded by controlling, intervening authority.\u201d).\nTo decide whether California carjacking constitutes a crime of violence after Johnson, we employ the categorical approach. That is, we consider whether every violation of the statute necessarily involves violent force. Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 190-91, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013). In that inquiry, we look at \u201cboth the text of the state statute and the state courts\u2019 interpretations of the statute\u2019s terms,\u201d and we treat state cases examining \u201cthe outer contours of the conduct criminalized by the state statute\u201d as \u201cparticularly important.\u201d United States v. Strickland, 860 F.3d 1224, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nRecently, in People v. Hudson, 11 Cal.App.5th 831, 217 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 782 (2017), the California Court of Appeal clarified the level of \u201cforce or fear\u201d required to sustain a state conviction for carjacking. The court explained that California carjacking \u201crequires only force in excess of that required to seize the vehicle,\u201d however slight that may be. Id. Beyond that, the amount of force used is irrelevant. People v. Lopez, 8 Cal.App.5th 1230, 214 Cal.Rptr.3d 618, 622 (2017). California\u2019s carjacking statute thus does not require the violent force that Johnson demands of a crime of violence.\nHudson\u2019s facts are illustrative. There, the defendant took a car from a car dealership. Hudson, 217 Cal.Rptr.3d at 776. As the defendant began to drive the car away, an employee tried to stop him by banging on the trunk, opening the driver\u2019s door, and trying to grab the defendant. Id. at 776-77. There was no evidence that the defendant drove the car forcefully or fast. Id. at 777. But the movement of the car at about 5 to 10 miles per hour, while the dealership employee was attempting to stop the defendant, was sufficient \u201cforce\u201d to support a conviction. Id. That was so because, in California, \u201cthe application of force inherent [in driving a vehicle away]\u201d is enough to sustain a carjacking conviction, whenever the victim puts up the slightest resistance. Id. at 782; see also People v. Magallanes, 173 Cal.App.4th 529, 92 Cal.Rptr.3d 751, 755 (2009) (\u201cDefendant\u2019s action of attempting to drive away ... was sufficient.\u201d). It thus cannot be said that California carjacking requires the use of violent force. As Hudson shows, one can satisfy section 215(a)\u2019s force requirement by driving a car at a slow speed\u2014i.e., at a non-violent speed\u2014and without harming a person or property. Because California carjacking does not require the violent force that Johnson demands, California carjacking is not a crime of violence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\nOur recent holding in United States v. Gutierrez, 876 F.3d 1254 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam), is not to the contrary. There, we held that the federal offense of carjacking is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Id. at 1257. But the federal definition of carjacking is quite different from California\u2019s definition:\nWhoever, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm[,] takes a motor vehicle ... from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do so, shall [be punished according to law].\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119.\nAs we observed in Gutierrez, carjacking \u201ccommitted \u2018by force and violence\u2019 ... obviously qualifies as a crime of violence under the Johnson standard.\u201d 876 F.3d at 1266 (emphasis added). But a person need not use force and violence to commit California carjacking. Rather, a person need use only more force than that required to seize the vehicle. Hudson, 217 Cal.Rptr.3d at 782. And, for the reasons explained above, that, quantum of force does not always involve the element of violence that Johnson requires.\nSimilarly, our decision in United States v. Ayala-Nicanor, 659 F.3d 744 (9th Cir. 2011), does not require a different result here. There, we held that Johnson did not undermine our decision in United States v. Laurico-Yeno, 590 F.3d 818 (9th Cir. 2010), which held .that, a California statute criminalizing the infliction of corporal-injury on certain relatives was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. But in Laurico-Yeno, unlike in Nieves-Medrano, the opinion extensively considered the degree of violence required to commit the crime, concluding that the statute at issue required intentional, active violence sufficient to inflict trauma on another person. Laurico-Yeno, 590 F.3d at 821. Thus, Johnson did not \u201ceffectively overrule\u201d Laurico-Yeno because, in Laurico-Yeno, we already had conducted the violence analysis that Johnson would later require. Here, both the statute at issue and our pr \u00bf-Johnson analysis of it differ significantly from the statute at issue in Laurico-Yeno and our pre-Johnson analysis of it.\nB. Theft Offense\nIn reviewing a petition, we \u201cconsider only the grounds relied upon by the BIA.\u201d Singh v. Holder, 649 F.3d 1161, 1164 n.6 (9th Cir. 2011) (enhanc) (internal quotation- marks omitted). When the BIA\u2019s decision \u201ccannot be sustained upon its reasoning, we must remand to allow the agency to decide any issues remaining in the case.\u201d Andia v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir: 2004) (per curiam).\nHere, because the BIA disposed of Petitioner\u2019s appeal on the theory that California carjacking is a crime of violence, it did not consider the IJ\u2019s alternate holding that California carjacking qualifies as a theft offense. We therefore remand the case to the BIA for it to consider in the first instance, whether Petitioner\u2019s carjacking conviction qualifies as a theft offense under 8 U:S.C.'\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).\nCONCLUSION\nCalifornia carjacking is not a crime of violence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), and our holding to the contrary in Nieves-Medrano is no longer good law after Johnson. The question remains, though, whether California, carjacking is a theft offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 U01(a)(43)(G), and we remand the case for the BIA to consider that issue!\nPetition GRANTED; REMANDED.\n. Tide 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) incorporates the \"crime of violence\u201d definition in 18 \u2022U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), which defines a \"crime of violence\u201d as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d\n. We do not opine today on whether Becerril-Lopez remains controlling law after Johnson. Our post-Johnson decision in United States v. Flores-Mejia, 687 F.3d 1213, 1214 (9th Cir. 2012), suggests that it might. What matters here, though, is only that Beceiril-Lopez did not explore expressly what level of violence the California robbery law requires.\n. Ayala-Nicanor\u2019s additional suggestion that Johnson should not apply to the term \u201cviolence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, Ayala-Nicanor, 659 F.3d at 751 n.3, is in tension with our later decision in Rodriguez-Castellon v. Holder, 733 F.3d 847, 854 (9th Cir. 2013), where we held clearly that Johnson\u2019s definition of violence applies in the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 context. Because the issue of Johnson\u2019s applicability to \u00a7 16 was not \"presented for review\u201d in Ayala-Nicanor\u2014a case that concerned only the term \"crime of violence\u201d as used in the Sentencing Guidelines\u2014we consider its treatment of 18 U.S.C. \u00a716 non-binding dictum.
