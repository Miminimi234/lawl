        "text": "RILEY, Chief Judge.\nL.T. Simes, II, is the first African-American circuit court (trial court) judge elected in Phillips County, Arkansas. During disciplinary proceedings against him before the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission (commission), Simes filed a federal lawsuit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against the commission and six of its officials: five commissioners and Executive Director David Stewart (collectively, officials). The district court denied Simes\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order and stayed federal proceedings in accordance with the Younger abstention doctrine, see Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). The state disciplinary proceedings ended with a decision by the Arkansas Supreme Court (1) accepting the commission\u2019s findings that Simes violated two canons of the Arkansas Code of Judicial Conduct; (2) rejecting the commission\u2019s findings that Simes violated four other canons; and (3) ordering the commission to reprimand Simes. See Ark. Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm\u2019n v. Simes, 381 S.W.3d 764, 769, 779 (Ark.2011) (Simes II). The district court then granted the commission and officials\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) motion to dismiss, finding no justiciable federal controversy. Considering Simes\u2019 appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and reviewing the record and the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinions, we affirm.\n1. BACKGROUND\nA. Arkansas State Proceedings\nSimes alleges the following facts. Since 1997, Simes has been an elected trial level judge in Phillips County, Arkansas. Voters re-elected him in 2000, 2004, and 2010. Simes\u2019 judicial career did not lead him to renounce his extrajudicial activities as a \u201csuccessful business man [sic],\u201d notably co-owning a local radio station and producing a CD of religious music (composed and sung by Simes himself).\nBetween 2004 and 2007, more complaints were filed against Simes \u201cthan any other judge under the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d During this period, the commission sanctioned Simes twice, once \u201cfor appearing in his judicial robes on the cover of a CD he produced\u201d and once for \u201c \u2018making personal solicitations for campaign contributions\u2019 during his 2004 election.\u201d In early 2008, the commission notified Simes the commission would hold probable cause hearings in five of the pending complaints against him. Simes agreed to a letter of reprimand in one of the complaints, based upon his two-month delay in entering an order after having ruled from the bench in a time-sensitive election dispute. See Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm\u2019n, Letter of Reprimand, Case No. 07-259 (2008). The commission dismissed one of the complaints (No. 07-142), and found probable cause for disciplinary hearings on the remaining three complaints (Nos. 06-171, 05-112, and 05-123).\nThe first case to proceed to a disciplinary hearing was number 06-171, referred to by Simes as the \u201cChandler case.\u201d Proceedings took place in early 2009, and the commission recommended the Arkansas Supreme Court \u201cpermanently remove[ ] [Simes] from his position as Circuit Judge for practicing law and serving as a fiduciary while on the bench.\u201d In Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm\u2019n v. Simes, 354 S.W.3d 72 (Ark.2009) (Simes I), the Arkansas Supreme Court unanimously agreed with the commission that Simes \u201ccreated the appearance, in reasonable minds, that [he] was unable to perform his duties with integrity, impartiality, and competence.\u201d Id. at 79; see id. at 85 (Hannah,-C.J., concurring and dissenting); id. at 87 (Danielson, J., concurring and dissenting). The Arkansas Supreme Court also found Simes improperly \u201cengaged in the practice of law\u201d and \u201cserved as a fiduciary ... while he was a judge.\u201d Id. at 78-79 (majority opinion). Although two justices would have permanently removed Simes from the bench, see id. at 85 (Hannah, C.J., concurring and dissenting), the majority voted to suspend Simes without pay until the end of his term, allowing him to run for re-election and, if re-elected, resume his judicial duties. See id. at 85.\nThe remaining two complaints, numbers 05-112 and 05-123, which both arose from what Simes calls \u201cthe Weaver case,\u201d were \u201cmerged on November 21, 2008 for a disciplinary hearing.\u201d Hearings on these complaints occurred in 2010, leading to a second recommendation for Simes\u2019 removal based on six violations of Arkansas\u2019 judicial code. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld two and rejected four of the violations based in part upon procedural irregularities related to other charges that Simes should not have personally overseen proceedings in which he sua sponte sanctioned parties for requesting his recusal. See Simes II, 381 S.W.3d at 772, 774, 779.\nB. Federal Proceedings\nOn July 23, 2010, amid ongoing disciplinary proceedings in \u201cthe Weaver case,\u201d Simes filed a federal complaint in the Eastern District of Arkansas and moved for a temporary restraining order. The district court denied Simes\u2019 TRO motion on July 27, 2010, finding none of the four temporary injunction factors weighed in Simes\u2019 favor. Faced with a motion to dismiss, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (2), & (4)-(6), the district court stayed proceedings, finding Younger abstention was warranted to avoid interference with ongoing state proceedings.\nAfter the state proceedings ended with a reprimand order in Simes' II, Simes amended his federal complaint. His amended complaint asserted two causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 related to* the commission\u2019s handling of the many judicial compl\u00e1ints filed against him. The first cause of action alleged the commission and officials \u201ctargeted [Simes] for permanent removal\u201d based on his race in violation of the U.S. and Arkansas Constitutions and state law. The second cause of action, directed solely against Stewart, alleged \u201cfalse and intentionally defamatory statements\u201d in violation of the \u201cFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States ... and State law as well.\u201d According to Simes, \u201cStewart announced publicly that [Simes] had been accused of ordering a newspaper reporter not to write a story, of improperly pressuring a Mayor of Helena-West Helena to reinstate a fired employee, and attempting to prevent people from talking to the Commission.\u201d Simes demanded declaratory judgment -relief, injunctions, compensatory and punitive damages, and legal fees. The commission and officials promptly moved to dismiss.\nOn September 27, 2012, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed the case. The district court found all the defendants were entitled to immunity from damages: the commission, a state entity, by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; the commissioners by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment and their quasi-judicial capacities; and Stewart by virtue of his prosecu-torial capacity. As to non-monetary relief,the district court found Simes\u2019 allegations, even if true, presented no justiciable federal controversy because they centered on past conduct. As to Simes\u2019 second cause of action against Stewart, the district court found the allegations did not \u201cstate[] a claim cognizable under federal law.\u201d The court declined to exercise jurisdiction over any state law claim Simes might have against Stewart. Accordingly, the district court entered judgment in favor of the commission and officials. Simes appeals.\nII. DISCUSSION\n\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, accepting as true all factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d Richter v. Advance Auto Parts, Inc., 686 F.3d 847, 850 (8th Cir.2012) (per curiam). The district court\u2019s decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Crest Constr. II, Inc. v. Doe, 660 F.3d 346, 359 (8th Cir.2011).\nA. First Cause of Action\nThe district court, applying settled and straightforward principles, concluded Stewart is entitled to prosecutorial immunity for his involvement in Simes\u2019 disciplinary proceedings. This absolute immunity applies to the first cause of action against Stewart.\nOn appeal, Simes attempts to couch Stewart\u2019s essentially prosecutorial work \u2014 screening complaints and determining which ones merited further action \u2014 as administrative functions not covered by prosecutorial immunity. Cf. Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 424-25, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Deciding which allegations to charge is the heart of prosecutorial discretion, absolutely protected by immunity. See, e.g., Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 274 n. 5, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993) (noting absolute immunity applies to \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s decision to bring an indictment, whether he has probable cause or not\u201d). Stewart\u2019s role in choosing which of the many complaints against Simes to pursue was \u201cfunctionally comparable to that of a prosecutor.\u201d Thomason v. SCAN Volunteer Servs., Inc., 85 F.3d 1365, 1373 (8th Cir.1996). Therefore, Stewart is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity as to Simes\u2019 claims for damages on the first cause of action.\nB. Second Cause of Action\nAlthough prosecutorial immunity does not absolutely shield statements to the press, see Buckley, 509 U.S. at 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2606, the district court (1) found Simes\u2019 second cause of action offered no prospect of damages because the relevant allegations \u201camount[ed] to nothing more than a state law defamation claim,\u201d and (2) declined to \u201cexercise its discretion to assume supplemental jurisdiction over that claim.\u201d\nAs to the first point, the district court was correct. Looking at Simes\u2019 complaint, there is no reason to think Stewart\u2019s statements to the media, even if inaccurate, had a chilling effect on Simes\u2019 exercise of his First Amendment rights. See, e.g., Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972). Nor is there any basis for inferring Stewart\u2019s statements violated Simes\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment rights. See, e.g., Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 712, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).\nAs to the second point, Simes does not meaningfully challenge the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion and, even if Simes has not waived the issue, the district court did not abuse its discretion. See, e.g., Carlsbad Tech., Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., 556 U.S. 635, 689, 129 S.Ct. 1862, 173 L.Ed.2d 843 (2009) (\u201cA district court\u2019s decision whether to exercise [supplemental] jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary.\u201d). Consequently, Simes has no justiciable claim for damages against any defendant in this case.\nC. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\nHaving concluded Simes had no prospect of obtaining damages from the commission or the officials, the district court found Simes\u2019 requests for declaratory and injunctive relief were moot. The district court again was correct.\nAll outstanding disciplinary proceedings (related to complaint Nos. 06-171, 05-1\u00cd2, and 05-123) against Simes have been definitively resolved by the Arkansas Supreme Court. See Simes II, 381 5.W.3d at 779; Simes I, 354 S.W.3d at 83-85. Even if Simes could prove these now settled state disciplinary proceedings were racially motivated, he could obtain no relief in this collateral federal case. Retrospective damages are barred by sovereign, quasi-judicial, and prosecutorial immunity, and the district court has no jurisdiction to offer prospective relief. Article III does not authorize federal courts to offer legal advice about hazy potentialities. See, e.g., O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (\u201cPast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\u201d). This case is \u201cmoot \u2014 and therefore no longer a \u2018Case\u2019 or \u2018Controversy\u2019 for purposes of Article III \u2014 [because] \u2018the issues presented are no longer \u201clive\u201d [and] the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 721, 726-27, 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013) (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481, 102 S.Ct. 1181, 71 L.Ed.2d 353 (1982) (per curiam)).\nSimes tries to wedge his case into the mootness exception for claims \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d but his case does not fit. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399-400, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). Even overlooking Simes\u2019 failure to analyze this exception in any meaningful way, see, e.g., Vandenboom v. Barnhart, 421 F.3d 745, 750 (8th Cir.2005) (refusing to consider an argument on which the moving party \u201cprovide[d] no analysis of the relevant law or facts\u201d), Simes offers no reason to expect the commission (now chaired by the Honorable Joyce Williams Warren, \u201cthe first black female judge in Arkansas\u201d) will target Simes on the basis of race. Nor is there reason to think such an implausible action by the commission would evade Arkansas and Supreme Court judicial review.\nTo think otherwise would require us to assume (1) judicial complaints will be filed against Simes, (2) the commission\u2019s executive director \u2014 now no longer Stewart \u2014 will decide to pursue at least one of those complaints, (3) the executive director will do so on the basis of Simes\u2019 race, (4) the commission will determine further action is warranted, (5) the commission will make that determination on the basis of Simes\u2019 race, (6) the commission will recommend sanctions against Simes, (7) the commission will make that recommendation on the basis of Simes\u2019 race, and (8) the Arkansas Supreme Court will accept that recommendation. Although Simes\u2019 past behavior might suggest new complaints against him are possible, the remaining assumptions are several \u201csteps removed from reality\u201d\u2014 \u201cso remote and speculative that ... there [is] a want of a subject matter on which any judgment of this Court could operate.\u201d Super Tire Eng\u2019g Co. v. McCorkle, 416 U.S. 115, 123, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (quotation omitted).\nAnd even if all of those assumptions proved true, the commission by its very existence is subject to judicial review, first by the Arkansas Supreme Court and then, on federal questions, by the U.S. Supreme Court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a); Ark. Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm\u2019n R.P. 12(C). Simes\u2019 argument that \u201cthe likelihood of the United States Supreme Court deigning to review such a case is so remote as to be nonexistent\u201d demonstrates a misunderstanding of federalism. Out of respect for our country\u2019s fundamental federalist principles, federal judges \u2014 from Supreme Court Justices to Circuit Judges to District, Magistrate, and Bankruptcy Judges \u2014 whenever possible \u201cavoid[] [the] invocation of federal supremacy over local laws.\u201d N.J. Payphone Ass\u2019n v. Town of W. N.Y., 299 F.3d 235, 249 (3d Cir.2002) (Alito, J., concurring). But when necessary, the Supreme Court has not hesitated to decide federal questions involving state judges, see, e.g., Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009), and state disciplinary proceedings, see, e.g., Peel v. Att\u2019y Registration & Disciplinary Comm\u2019n of Ill, 496 U.S. 91, 110 S.Ct. 2281, 110 L.Ed.2d 83 (1990).\nIII. CONCLUSION\nSeeing no justiciable federal \u201cCase[ ]\u201d or \u201cControversfy],\u201d U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2, we affirm the well-reasoned opinions and judgment of the district court.\n. Although Simes initially named three other commissioners and nine alternate members of the commission as defendants, he later dropped his suit against them, leaving only the \u201cDefendants-Appellees\u201d listed above as parties to this case.\n. The Honorable Joseph F. Bataillon, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation following the recusals of all district judges in the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas.\n. As this appeal arises from a dismissal on the pleadings, we present these facts on the assumption that the allegations in Simes' complaint are true. See, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Joshi v. St. Luke\u2019s Hosp., Inc., 441 F.3d 552, 555 (8th Cir.2006).\n. The conduct which led to this finding also earned Simes a \"caution\u201d sanction for his legal work from the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct, which required Simes to pay \"restitution of legal fees\u201d to the affected party.\n. Simes' appeal does not challenge the district court's conclusion the commission and commissioners are immune from suit for damages.\n. Biography of Judge Joyce Williams Warren, Ark. Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm\u2019n, http://www.arkansas.gov/jddc/biocomm_2001. html (last visited October 28, 2013).\n. Simes has never alleged the Arkansas Supreme Court, which indisputably found sanctions warranted against Simes in each case the commission brought against him in that court, acted based upon improper motives.",
