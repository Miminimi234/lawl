Dahlin worked for two companies as a commercial truck driver; For both, he loaded his truck with benzene-containing pyrolysis gasoline at a petrochemical facility in Clinton, Iowa. He transported the gasoline to a storage facility where he unloaded it. He then returned to the Clinton facility, reloaded, and went back to the storage facility. Drivers did this four-to-six times a day during the summer.\nDean\u2019s employers did not own the Clinton facility. From 1988 until late. 1993, Quantum Chemical Corporation owned it. In late 1993, Hanson, PLC acquired the Corporation, changing its name to Quantum . Chemical Company. The name changed back to Quantum Chemical Corporation in 1996\u2014until March 1997, when it became Millennium Petrochemical, Inc. Later in 1997, Millenium formed a joint venture with Lyondell Chemical Company called Equistar Chemicals, LP. Equistar became the Clinton facility\u2019s owner. In 2004, Equistar became Lyondell Chemical Company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary.\nIn 2009, Equistar and Lyondell Chemical Company, with other affiliated companies, petitioned for Chapter li bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan in 2010, discharging all existing debts.\nDean was diagnosed in 2012 with myelo-dysplastic syndrome, which transformed to acute myeloid leukemia. Dean passed away from AML. His widow, Cheri Dahlin, sued Lyondell, alleging that Dean\u2019s benzene exposure at the. Clinton facility caused his disease.\nLyondell moved for summary judgment, arguing that Dahlin\u2019s claim was discharged in bankruptcy. The district court denied the motion. See Dahlin v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., 2015 WL 11675667 (S.D. Iowa Sept. 29, 2015). A jury awarded Dah-lin $1.76 million in compensatory damages and $1.76 million in. punitive damages. Post-trial, the district, court vacated the punitive damages, but rejected Lyondell\u2019s other arguments. Lyondell appeals. Dahlin cross-appeals to reinstate the punitive damages.\nII.\nLyondell says that Dahlin\u2019s claim was discharged in bankruptcy. The first question is whether this court can review this issue. Lyondell did not raise the discharge issue in a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Instead, it relies on the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment.\n\u201cIt is generally true that a denial of summary judgment is interlocutory in nature and not appealable after trial and judgment.\u201d New York Marine & Gen. Ins. Co. v. Continental Cement Co., LLC, 761 F.3d 830, 837 (8th Cir. 2014). \u201c[T]he proper- redress for an argument denied at sum-raary judgment is not through appeal of that denial, \u2018but through subsequent motions for judgment as a matter of law and appellate review of those motions if they were denied.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 838, quoting White Consol. Indus., Inc. v. McGill Mfg. Co., 165 F.3d 1185, 1189 (8th Cir. 1999).\nThis court, however, has \u201cnot indiscriminately foreclose^] all appeals taken from the denial of an issue raised at summary judgment. ... [A] distinction [exists] between the denial of a summary judgment motion involving the merits of a claim and one involving preliminary issues, such as a statute of limitations, collateral estoppel, or standing.\u201d Id. This court cannot review the denial of summary judgment on an issue involving the merits. See id. But it can review a preliminary issue. Id.\nAs the district court noted, the discharge issue does not involve the merits of Dahlin\u2019s claim. Dahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *1 n.1. Like statute of limitations, collateral estoppel, and standing, a bankruptcy discharge issue \u201cis generally preliminary to determination of the merits in a case.\u201d See New York Marine, 761 F.3d at 838. This court may review whether Dahlin\u2019s claim was discharged in Lyondell\u2019s bankruptcy.\nThis court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court. Rosemann v. St. Louis Bank, 858 F.3d 488, 494 (8th Cir. 2017); ReliaStar Life Ins. Co. v. IOA Re, Inc., 303 F.3d 874, 878 (8th Cir. 2002). Whether a bankruptcy notice satisfies due process is a mixed question of law and fact. See Stauch v. City of Columbia Heights, 212 F.3d 425, 431 (8th Cir. 2000) (\u201cAlthough, the question of whether the procedural safeguards provided for in the Code are adequate to satisfy due process is a question of law for the court to determine, whether the City indeed .provided the Stauches with such procedure is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d). \u201cThe burden of establishing that a creditor has received appropriate notice rests with the debtor.\u201d In re Hairopoulos, 118 F.3d 1240, 1244 (8th Cir. 1997).\nIII.\n\u201c[T]he confirmation of a [Chapter 11 bankruptcy] plan ... discharges the debt- or from any debt' that arose before the date of such confirmation.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(1)(A). A \u201cdebt\u201d is a \u201cliability on a'claim.\u201d \u00a7 101(12). Dahlin\u2019s lawsuit is a \u201cclaim.\u201d See \u00a7 101(5)(A) (a \u201cclaim\u201d includes any \u201cright to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured\u201d); Boston & Maine Corp. v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 587 F.3d 89, 100 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cA contingent claim is [a] claim that has not yet accrued and is dependent on some future event that may never happen.\u201d) (citation and, internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe district court ruled that Dah-lin\u2019s claim arose before the confirmation of Lyondell\u2019s bankruptcy plan. Dahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *8. Dahlin does not challenge that ruling, also acknowledging she did not file a proof of claim. The district court\u2019s ruling would generally mean that Dahlin\u2019s claim was discharged because \u201ca cause of action that accrues prior to the confirmation of the plan constitutes a \u2018claim\u2019 dischargeable upon confirmation.\u201d Sanchez v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 659 F.3d. 671, 675 (8th Cir. 2011); see also \u00a7 1141(d)(1)(A). Despite that general rule, the-district court concluded that Dahlin\u2019s claim was not discharged because Lyondell violated Dean\u2019s due process rights by not providing sufficient notice of its bankruptcy. Dahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *13.\nA.\n\u201cInadequate notice is a defect which precludes discharge of a claim in bankruptcy.\u201d Chemetron Corp. v. Jones, 72 F.3d 341, 346 (3d Cir. 1995). \u201cThe operation of the Bankruptcy Code, including its discharge provisions, is subject to due process constraints.\u201d Sanchez, 659 F.3d at 675. Due process requires \u201cnotice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950).\n\u201c[BJefore a pre-petition or pre-confirmation claim can be discharged under the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor\u2019s creditors must be afforded notice of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy case, as well as the deadline for asserting any pre-petition claims against the debt- or.\u201d Sanchez, 659 F.3d at 675, quoting Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Tessler (In re J.A. Jones, Inc.), 492 F.3d 242, 249 (4th Cir. 2007). \u201cAbsent such notice, creditors lack \u2018the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the course of bankruptcy proceedings.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting Hairopoulos, 118 F.3d at 1244.\nThe level of notice that satisfies due process depends on whether the creditor is \u201cknown\u201d or \u201cunknown.\u201d See Chemetron, 72 F.3d at 346. \u201cKnown creditors must be provided with actual written notice of a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy filing and bar claims date.\u201d Id. \u201cFor unknown claimants, notification by publication will generally suffice.\u201d Id.; see also Tulsa Prof'l Collection Serv., Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 490, 108 S.Ct. 1340, 99 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988) (\u201cFor creditors who are not \u2018reasonably ascertainable,\u2019 publication notice can suffice.\u201d).\nB.\nThe district court concluded that Dean was an unknown creditor entitled only to publication notice. Dahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *11. The notice listed over 90 companies as debtors. It included the statutory definition of \u201cclaim,\u201d noting the deadlines to file a proof of claim. It described who must file a proof of claim, and where and what to file. It explained the consequences of not filing a proof of claim before the bar date. Lyondell published the notice in the national edition of USA Today, the national and international editions of the Wall Street Journal, and regional newspapers, including the Clinton Herald, circulated in Clinton, Iowa. See Chemetron, 72 F.3d at 348-49 (\u201cPublication in national newspapers is regularly deemed sufficient notice to unknown creditors, especially where supplemented, as here, with notice in papers of general circulation in locations where the debtor is conducting business.\u201d).\nThe district court ruled that the content of Lyondell\u2019s notice did not satisfy due process. Dahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *13. It emphasized that the notice did not mention Quantum Chemical Corporation, Hanson PLC, or Quantum Chemical Company\u2014the owners of the Clinton facility when Dean worked there. Id. But the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure required Lyondell to list only names used within the eight years before the filing of the bankruptcy petition. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1005 and 2002(n). Quantum Chemical Corporation, Hanson PLC, or Quantum Chemical Company were not used within the eight-year window. Despite that, the district court concluded:\n[Compliance with the bankruptcy rules was not sufficient to satisfy due process under the particular circumstances of this case. Though the bankruptcy rules are created to safeguard creditor\u2019s rights, they are not necessarily co-extensive with the protection of due process. Because Defendants here should have known of their potential liability for pre-1997 benzene claims, Defendants should have listed Quantum Chemical Corporation, Hanson PLC, and Quantum Chemical Company in their Notice. Their failure to do so violated Dean\u2019s due process rights.\nThe relative uncertainty of future benzene claims, albeit uncertainty of who would bring the claims, created a duty for Defendants to provide some notice to this group of claimants.\nDahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *12-13. The district court stressed: (1) two years before bankruptcy, Lyondell was fined $2.5 million by the EPA and agreed to invest $200,000 on environmental projects in Clinton, (2) benzene claims were 10% of Lyondell\u2019s yearly toxic-tort litigation, and (3) the EPA conducted a study documenting benzene contamination at the Clinton facility, designated it a \u201cSuperfund site,\u201d and required benzene remediation. Id. at *12. The district court also said: \u201cHad the Notice mentioned benzene or the Clinton Complex, it perhaps would have satisfied due process.\u201d Id. at *13.\nIV.\nThe notice did not need to mention benzene claims or the Clinton facility in order to satisfy due process. See In re Placid Oil Co., 753 F.3d 151, 158 (5th Cir. 2014) (\u201cWe have never required bar date notices to contain information about specific potential claims.\u201d). Instead, the key issue is whether the notice should have listed the names Quantum Chemical Corporation, Hanson PLC, or Quantum Chemical Company.\nCompliance with the bankruptcy rules might not satisfy due process. See In re Flynn, 402 B.R. 437, 445 n.11 (1st Cir. B.A.P. 2009) (\u201c[R]egardless of what the Bankruptcy Rules allow, they may not be used to circumvent constitutional due process requirements. Notification procedures set forth in rules \u2018neither trump nor displace the constitutional requirement that ... [the] notice [be] sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process.\u2019 \u201d) (alteration in original), quoting United States v. One Star Class Sloop Sailboat, 458 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 2006). The circumstances of a case might require a debtor to provide more information than necessary under the bankruptcy rules.\nThe district court ruled that because Lyondell should have known of its potential liability for pre-1997 benzene claims, it should' have given more notice than the bankruptcy rules require. This ruling exceeds the bounds of the process due to an unknown creditor.\nAn unknown creditor is one whose \u201cinterests are either conjectural or future or, although they could be discovered upon investigation, do not in due course of business come to knowledge [of the debtor].\u201d Mullane, 339 U.S. at 317, 70 S.Ct. 652. A \u201cknown\u201d creditor is one whose identity is either known or \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d by the debtor. Tulsa Prof'l, 485 U.S. at 489-90, 108 S.Ct. 1340. \u201cA creditor\u2019s identity is \u2018reasonably ascertainable\u2019 if that creditor can be identified through \u2018reasonably diligent efforts.\u2019 \u201d Chemetron, 72 F.3d at 346, quoting Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, 462 U.S. 791, 798 n.4, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180 (1983). Reasonable diligence does not require \u201cimpracticable and extended searches ... in the name of due process.\u201d Mullane, 339 U.S. at 317-18, 70 S.Ct. 652. As the Third Circuit said:\nA debtor does not have a duty to search out each conceivable or possible creditor and urge that person or entity to make a claim against it.\n[W]hat is required is not a vast, open-ended investigation. The requisite search instead focuses on the debtor\u2019s own books and records. Efforts beyond a careful examination of these documents are generally not required. Only those* claimants who are identifiable through a diligent search are \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d and hence \u201cknown\u201d creditors.\nChemetron, 72 F.3d at 346-47 (internal citations, quotation marks, and footnote omitted).\nAs the district court concluded, Lyondell conducted a reasonably diligent search for creditors. Dahlin, 2015 WL 11675667, at *11. It hired an experienced bankruptcy consulting firm that reviewed Lyondell\u2019s employee, vendor, accounts payable, and contract registers. That firm identified over one million reasonably ascertainable creditors. Dean was not one of them. After a reasonably diligent search for known creditors, publication notice generally suffices for unknown creditors. See Tulsa Prof'l, 485 U.S. at 490, 108 S.Ct. 1340. Lyondell gave notice by publication.\nFor Lyondell\u2019s notice to satisfy due process, the district court would require Lyondell to conduct another search beyond a. reasonably diligent search for known creditors. By the district court\u2019s rationale, the over 90 debtors should have analyzed the bases of every type of toxic tort that could be claimed against them and expanded the notice accordingly.' A debtor, however, need not undertake \u201cimpracticable and extended searches ... in the name of due process.\u201d Mullane, 339 U.S. at 317-18, 70 S.Ct. 652. This court finds no' authority requiring a second search, and neither did the district court.\nInstead, the district court used a foreseeability test\u2014that Lyondell should' have listed the three companies because it should have known of future benzene claims. In Chemetron, the Third Circuit rejected a foreseeability analysis in evaluating due process of bankruptcy notices. Chemetron, 72 F.3d at 347-48.\nBetween 1965 and 1972, the Chemetron defendant used depleted uranium at one of its facilities. Id. at 344. Part of that facility was demolished in 1972, with some rubble placed in a landfill the defendant owned. In 1975, the defendant sold both the facility and the landfill. After the sale but before bankruptcy, increased radiation levels were detected at the facility, and the defendant conducted \u201cperiodic clean-up efforts\u201d at the facility and the landfill. Id. In 1988, the defendant filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It provided actual and publication notice of its claim-bar date. Id. at 345.\nFour years later, 'the plaintiffs\u2014who lived or spent time around the landfill\u2014 sued. Id. They did not receive actual notice of the claim-bar date. See id. The bankruptcy court ruled that the plaintiffs were known creditors because the defendant '\u201cknew or should have known that it- was reasonably foreseeable that it could suffer claims from individuals living near the\u201d landfill. Id. at 347 (emphasis added).\nThe Third Circuit held that the bankruptcy court should have applied a \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d standard, not a \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard. Id.\nDebtors cannot be required to provide actual notice to anyone who potentially could have been affected by their actions; such a requirement would completely vitiate the important goal of prompt and effectual administration and settlement of debtors\u2019 estates.\nWhere a debtor has sought the protection of bankruptcy law ... procedural protections such as the bar claims date apply. These provisions cannot be circumvented by forcing debtors to anticipate speculative suits based on lengthy chains of causation.\nId. at 348. Under a \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d standard, the court found that the plaintiffs were unknown, so publication notice satisfied due process. Id. at 348-49. This court agrees with the Third Circuit and rejects the foreseeability approach the district court used here.\nBesides foreseeability, the district court did not provide a reason why Lyon-dell had to go beyond the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Under the circumstances, Lyondell\u2019s notice satisfied due process. See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 662; Chemetron, 72 F.3d at 348-49; Placid, 753 F.3d at 158. A \u201c[critical feature[ ] of every bankruptcy proceeding [includes] ... the ultimate discharge that gives.the debtor a \u2018fresh start\u2019 by releasing him, her, or it from further liability for old debts.\u201d Central Virginia Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 363-64, 126 S.Ct. 990, 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006).\nDahlin\u2019s claim arose before the confirmation of Lyondell\u2019s bankruptcy plan. No proof of claim was filed. This lawsuit was discharged in bankruptcy. See Sanchez, 659 F.3d at 675; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(1)(A). This court need not address the other issues that Dahlin briefs or the cross-appeal.\nThe judgment is vacated and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.",
