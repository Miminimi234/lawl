        "text": "OPINION\nN.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(c) precludes compensation to an injured employee if \u201cthe injury was occasioned solely by [his] intoxication.\u201d This language precludes recovery where the intoxication of the employee was the sole \u201clegal cause\u201d of the injury. \u201cLegal cause\u201d is the causal connection in fact, which extends not only to positive and active physical forces, but also to pre-existing passive conditions. Cf. Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. 830, 837-39, 116 S.Ct. 1813, 135 L.Ed.2d 113 (1996); White v. Roper, 901 F.2d 1501, 1505-06 (9th Cir.1990). The Benefits Review Board (BRB) did not err when it affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ) denial of Schwirse\u2019s claim for compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA) due to intoxication. We have jurisdiction to review the petition under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c); we deny the petition for review.\nFACTS\nGary Sehwirse was employed by Marine Terminals Corporation (MTC) as an A-registered longshoreman. On January 8, 2006, Sehwirse drank two beers before going to work at 8:00 a.m. Between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., he drank an additional three beers. At lunch, Sehwirse consumed four to five more beers. Between the end of lunch and the end of the day (approximately 4:00 p.m.), Sehwirse also drank more than half a pint of whiskey.\nAt approximately 4:30 p.m., Sehwirse decided to relieve himself near the bull rail of MTC\u2019s dock. While doing so, Sehwirse fell over the bull rail onto a concrete and steel ledge (approximately six feet below the rail). After Schwirse\u2019s fall, he was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was diagnosed with acute alcohol intoxication (.29 serum level or .25 blood alcohol level), cannabis ingestion, and a severe scalp laceration to his right temple.\nThereafter, Sehwirse sought compensation for his injury under the LHWCA. However, MTC refused to pay the compensation, arguing that he had no claim for compensation under the LHWCA. MTC asserted that Sehwirse was precluded from receiving compensation under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(c), because his. intoxication was the sole cause of his injury.\nAt the hearing before the ALJ on June 21, 2007, Sehwirse stated that he could not remember the details of the incident. Instead, he asserted, based upon the statements of his co-workers (neither of whom testified), that the fall was due to tripping over a bright orange warning cone. However, in Schwirse\u2019s earlier deposition (taken on October 20, 2006), he recalled the facts differently. At that time, Sehwirse stated that neither of his coworkers actually saw what happened; instead, he was the one, who specifically recalled seeing and tripping over a traffic cone at the bull rail\u2019s edge. The ALJ awarded Sehwirse benefits. The ALJ determined that Schwirse\u2019s injury was not caused solely by intoxication, because there was no direct proof that intoxication (and not something else) caused him to fall. MTC appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the BRB. The BRB reversed the ALJ, finding that the employer rebutted the presumption that the injury was caused by something other than intoxication. The BRB noted that \u201c[i]t is not [the] employer\u2019s burden to prove on the record as a whole that intoxication was the sole cause of claimant\u2019s injury.\u201d\nSehwirse filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the BRB\u2019s ruling incorrectly stated the employer\u2019s burden of proof. After review of the motion, the BRB agreed with Schwirse\u2019s argument, correcting its prior opinion. Instead, the BRB stated that the burden of proof is on the employer and remanded the matter back to the ALJ to make further findings and weigh the relevant evidence.\nOn remand, the ALJ weighed the conflicting evidence and determined that MTC had established that intoxication was the sole cause of Schwirse\u2019s fall. Relying on the testimony of the marine manager, the ALJ concluded that the bull rail was free of tripping or slipping hazards. The ALJ also credited the testimony of Drs. Burton and Jacobsen, physicians testifying on behalf of MTC, that the sole cause of Schwirse\u2019s fall was due to intoxication. The ALJ thus concluded that there was \u201cno other explanation for [Schwirse\u2019s] industrial injury than his intoxication.\u201d The ALJ also rejected Schwirse\u2019s alterative argument that the concrete and metal slab (on which he fell) caused the injury rather than his intoxication.\nThe BRB affirmed the decision.\nDISCUSSION\n\u201cThe Longshore Act is a comprehensive scheme to provide compensation for the disability or death of employees resulting from injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States.\u201d Price v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., Inc., 697 F.3d 820, 823 (9th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a). However, \u201c[n]o compensation shall be payable if the injury was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(c). Despite this exclusion, the LHWCA provides that \u201ca claim for compensation ... shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary ... [t]hat the injury was not occasioned solely by the intoxication of the injured employee.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(c) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]he employer may rebut the presumption ... by presenting substantial evidence that is specific and comprehensive enough to sever the potential connection between the disability and the work environment.\u201d Hawaii Stevedores, Inc. v. Ogawa, 608 F.3d 642, 651 (9th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ then \u201cdetermines as a matter of law whether substantial rebuttal evidence has been presented.\u201d Id. If the ALJ determines that the employer rebutted the presumption, \u201cthe presumption in favor of the claimant \u2018falls out of the case\u2019 and the ALJ. moves to the third and final step of weighing the evidence as a whole \u2018to determine whether the claimant has established the necessary causal link between the injury and employment.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Bath Iron Works Corp. v. Fields, 599 F.3d 47, 54-55 (1st Cir.2010)). \u201cThis final- determination is a question of fact.\u201d Id. '\n1. The BRB did not err in interpreting 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(c).\nThis case turns, in part, on an interpretation of the LHWCA. We have held that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s interpretation of the LHWCA is a question of law reviewed de novo and is not entitled to any special deference.\u201d Stevedoring Servs. of Am. v. Price, 382 F.3d 878, 883 (9th Cir.2004) (citing Stevedoring Servs. of Am. v. Dir., OWCP, 297 F.3d 797, 801-02 (9th Cir.2002)). However, we \u201crespect the Board\u2019s interpretation ... if it \u2018is reasonable and reflects the underlying policy of the statute.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 883 (quoting Kelaita v. Dir., OWCP, 799 F.2d 1308, 1310 (9th Cir.1986)).\nUnder 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(c), \u201c[n]o compensation shall be payable if the injury was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee.\u201d Breaking the phrase into its parts, the LHWCA defines \u201cinjury\u201d as:\naccidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment, and such occupational disease or infection as arises naturally out of such employment or as naturally or unavoidably results from such accidental injury, and includes an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment.\n33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2). This definition does not fully address the language we must interpret here, whether the \u201cinjury was occasioned solely by\u201d a cause, in this case intoxication. The term \u201cinjury\u201d is modified by \u201coccasioned solely by,\u201d which requires us to determine whether intoxication was the \u201clegal cause\u201d of the injury (a \u201cbut for\u201d analysis).\nThe \u201coccasioned solely by\u201d phrase is not defined by the statute. In determining whether an employee\u2019s injury was \u201coccasioned solely by\u201d intoxication, we take guidance from those admiralty cases determining proximate cause. See Exxon, 517 U.S. at 839, 116 S.Ct. 1813. By analogy, we determine whether intoxication was the only or \u201csole\u201d cause by (1) looking at the act that caused the accident and (2) determining whether there were any superseding or intervening causes that contributed to the injury. Id. at 837-39, 116 S.Ct. 1813.\nThis interpretation is consistent with the BRB\u2019s application of a two-part test for determining whether the employer met its burden in establishing that intoxication was the sole cause of the accident. See Sheridon v. Petro-Drive, Inc., 18 BRBS 57, *2 (1986). First, the employer must establish \u201cthat the employee was drunk at the time of the accident.\u201d Id. (quoting Shearer v. Niagara Falls Power Co., 242 N.Y. 70, 150 N.E. 604, 605 (1982)). Second, the employer must establish that the employee \u201cfell owing to his drunkenness and was injured.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nWe therefore hold that an injury \u201coccasioned solely by\u201d intoxication means that the legal cause of the injury was intoxication, regardless of the surface material of the landing on which the intoxicated person fell. In other words, as aptly stated by the BRB, \u201c[i]f intoxication was the sole cause of the claimant\u2019s fall, then intoxication also was the sole cause of the claimant\u2019s injury.\u201d\nInstead, Schwirse argues an all-encompassing definition of the term injury. Relying on Johnson v. Dir., Office of Workers Compensation Programs, 911 F.2d 247, 250 (9th Cir.1990), Schwirse argues that Congress used the term \u201caccident,\u201d to mean the \u201cevent causing the harm,\u201d where it intended to limit compensation to the sole cause of the fall. In other words, by using the term \u201cinjury,\u201d Congress intended to incorporate the \u201charmful physical consequences of that event.\u201d Thus, Schwirse\u2019s definition would suggest that, because he hit the concrete surface rather than the river or a featherbed, his injury was not solely occasioned by intoxication. In other words, his \u201caccident\u201d may have been caused by intoxication, but harmful physical consequences of the fall (the injury) was caused by hitting the concrete and metal slab.\nWe reject Schwirse\u2019s interpretation. Accepting Schwirse\u2019s broad definition of the term \u201cinjury\u201d would violate a \u201ccardinal principle of statutory construction.\u201d See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001). In particular, if \u201cwe [were] to adopt [Schwirse\u2019s] construction of the statute, the express [intoxication] exception would be rendered insignificant, if not wholly superfluous.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and alternations omitted). Schwirse\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cinjury\u201d would read out the phrase \u201coccasioned solely by\u201d and preclude the application of \u00a7 903(c). Nearly every \u201charm\u201d would not be \u201coccasioned solely by the intoxication\u201d but rather by some further cause, such as the ground. Further, as noted by the Supreme Court, \u201cLife is too short to pursue every event to its most remote, \u2018but-for,\u2019 consequences, and the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough guide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of cause-and-effect.\u201d Pac. Operators Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 680, 692, 181 L.Ed.2d 675 (2012). We therefore conclude that the most logical way to interpret \u00a7 903(c) and \u00a7 920(c) of the LHWCA is to interpret the phrase \u201coccasioned solely by\u201d to limit the analysis to the sole causal factor of the injury.\n2. The BRB did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s finding that MTC produced sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory presumption that Schwirse\u2019s injury was not solely caused by intoxication.\nIn considering a claim for disability benefits under the LHWCA, the ALJ is required to follow a three part process. First, the claimant must show that he sustained an injury in the course and scope of his employment. See Albina Engine & Machine v. Dir., OWCP, 627 F.3d 1293, 1298 (9th Cir.2010). If an injury is established, a presumption arises that the injury was not occasioned solely by intoxication. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(c); see also Albina Engine, 627 F.3d at 1298. Second, the employer must present \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to rebut that presumption. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920; see also Albina Engine, 627 F.3d at 1298. Lastly, if the employer successfully rebuts the presumption, the ALJ must then evaluate whether the claimant met his burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence that the record as a whole justifies awarding benefits. Albina Engine, 627 F.3d at 1298.\nThe Board must accept the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3); see also Container Stevedoring Co. v. Dir., OWCP, 935 F.2d 1544, 1546 (9th Cir.1991). The Supreme Court has defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). We conduct an independent review to determine if the Board adhered to this standard. Bumble Bee Seafoods v. Dir., OWCP, 629 F.2d 1327, 1329 (9th Cir.1980).\nReviewing the BRB\u2019s decision, we conclude the BRB adhered to this standard and did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s denial of compensation under the LHWCA. First, there is no dispute that Schwirse sustained an injury while at work. Thus, a presumption arises that Schwirse\u2019s injury was not occasioned solely by intoxication. The BRB correctly concluded that substantial evidence in the record supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Schwirse\u2019s employer rebutted the presumption that intoxication was not the sole cause of Schwirse\u2019s injury. The BRB stated the correct standard of review regarding the ALJ\u2019s findings of facts. The BRB noted that the ALJ \u201cfound sufficient evidence, in the form of the opinions of Drs. Burton and Jacobsen, the testimony of Mr. Yockey, and photographs of the accident site...Based on this evidence, the ALJ ruled out any tripping hazards and then relied on the expertise of doctors to conclude intoxication was the sole cause. There was no evidence of any superseding or intervening cause of the injury. Further, there is no question that a foreseeable consequence of falling is that one may hit the pre-existing surface material. It is also foreseeable that the surface material surrounding the dock was hard and would cause significant injury. A preference that one may fall on more forgiving material (such as a featherbed or water) does not alter the \u201clegal cause\u201d of the injury. Thus, absent evidence of the surface material being unforeseeably defective, the \u201clegal cause\u201d is limited to the reason for his fall and the foreseeable consequences of that fall. Here, the ALJ found that the only known cause for Schwirse\u2019s injury was the fall off the bull rail attributable solely to his drunkenness. Thus the BRB did not err in concluding substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusions.\nWe further find no error in the BRB\u2019s conclusion that Schwirse\u2019s employer does not have to \u201crule out\u201d all other possible causes of injury in order to rebut the presumption under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(c). As noted by the BRB, the employer \u201cneed not negate every hypothetical cause.\u201d Sheridon, 18 BRBS 57, *3. To hold otherwise would contradict the statutory language, which only requires \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to rebut the presumption. See Ortco Contractors, Inc. v. Charpentier, 332 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]he BRB cannot require employers to rebut a [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a) ] presumption by \u2018ruling out\u2019 every conceivable connection between the injury and the claimant\u2019s employment. The LHWCA requires a lower evidentiary standard than this-the employer must adduce only substantial evidence that the injury was not work-related.\u201d).\nLastly, BRB correctly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny disability benefits, based on the record as a whole, was proper. As the Supreme Court stated in Del Vecchio v. Bowers,\nIf the employer alone adduces evidence which tends to support the theory [contrary to the presumption], the case must be decided upon that evidence. Where the claimant offers substantial evidence in opposition, ... the issue must be resolved upon the whole body of proof pro and con; and if it permits an inference either way upon the question ..., the Deputy Commissioner and he alone is empowered to draw the inference; his decision as to the weight of the evidence may not be disturbed by the court.\n296 U.S. 280, 286-87, 56 S.Ct. 190, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935) (footnotes omitted). The only alleged cause of Schwirse\u2019s injury that was supported by substantial evidence was Schwirse\u2019s intoxication. The ALJ properly \u201cweighted] the evidence as a whole \u2018to determine whether [Schwirse had] established the necessary causal link between the injury and employment.\u2019 \u201d Hawaii Stevedores, 608 F.3d at 651 (citation omitted).\nPETITION DENIED.\n. We further note that Schwirse presented no argument or evidence that the concrete and metal slab (on which he fell) was defective, and that such defect caused his injury to any extent. He only argued that the fall (onto a concrete and metal slab) caused his injury.\n. Having rebutted the presumption that the claimant\u2019s injury was not occasioned solely by intoxication under the substantial evidence standard, the employer does not further bear the burden of proving that the employee\u2019s injury was caused solely by intoxication under the preponderance of the evidence standard. Albina Engine clearly establishes that after the employer rebuts the presumption by sub- , stantial evidence, the burden shifts to the claimant to prove entitlement to benefits by a preponderance of the evidence. To the extent that it placed the burden at the latter stage on the employer, the BRB erred.",
