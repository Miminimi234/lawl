        "text": "STEARNS, District Judge.\nPetitioner Segundo Muyubisnay-Cunga-chi seeks review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying a motion to reconsider his motion to reopen based on changed country circumstances. He also appeals the denial of a second motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because we agree with the BIA that Muyubisnay-Cun-gachi has failed to establish a statutorily protected ground of persecution or to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny his petition.\nI. Facts and Background\nSegundo Muyubisnay-Cungachi (Muyu-bisnay) is a native and citizen of Ecuador who entered the United States illegally in 2001. Muyubisnay came to the attention of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after a routine traffic stop in November of 2008. On November 26, 2008, DHS instituted removal proceedings against him pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).\nMuyubisnay conceded his removability, but applied for withholding of removal and for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Muyubisnay claimed that he was fearful of returning to Ecuador because, as a member of an indigenous ethnic group, he has severely limited economic opportunities in his native country. The Immigration Judge (IJ), while finding that Muyubisnay had shown .instances of discrimination by Ecuadorian authorities against indigenous peoples, nevertheless found that Muyubisnay\u2019s unfavorable financial prospects did not constitute \u201cpersecution\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA). She further found that Muyubis-nay had submitted no credible evidence that he faced torture as defined by the CAT if he returned to Ecuador. On March 7, 2012, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of relief and protection.\nOn May 4, 2012, Muyubisnay filed a motion to reopen (First Motion to Reopen), claiming that his family circumstances and country conditions in Ecuador had worsened since his 2010 hearing before the IJ, compounding his fear of persecution. Muyubisnay related that his parents had become embroiled in a custody dispute with his brother-in-law, Luis Rog-erio Lala Huillca (Huillca), who had recently been released from jail and was now issuing death threats against his family. Muyubisnay claimed that the Ecuadorian police, because of his family\u2019s indigenous ethnicity, refused to protect them from Huillca. On July 25, 2012, the BIA denied the motion. In sum, the BIA held that an ultimatum from a private individual arising from a child custody dispute did not constitute official persecution under the INA.\nOn August 24, 2012, Muyubisnay filed a motion requesting that the BIA reconsider its decision rejecting his claim of persecution. Muyubisnay argued that the BIA\u2019s characterization of his family\u2019s risk of harm as hinging solely on a \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d minimized the extent to which the tenability of Huillca\u2019s threats was augmented by Ecuador\u2019s official policy of discrimination.\nThrough newly retained counsel, Muyu-bisnay also moved to reopen based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior counsel (Second Motion to Reopen). Mu-yubisnay claimed that prior counsel had denied him a fair opportunity to be heard by failing to produce expert testimony on the subject of discrimination by Ecuadorian authorities against indigenous peoples. In support, Muyubisnay submitted an affidavit from Lynn A. Meisch, professor of anthropology at Saint Mary\u2019s College of California, attesting that Huillca\u2019s unconstrained threats could legitimately be viewed as \u201ca form of state-backed persecution of [Petitioner\u2019s] family.\u201d\nOn October 10, 2012, the BIA denied both motions. With respect to the motion to reconsider, the BIA stated that it had never construed Muyubisnay\u2019s persecution claim as based \u201csolely\u201d on a custody dispute, but iterated that any danger posed by Huillca was personally motivated and had nothing to do with a purported official policy of discrimination. The BIA noted that the Second Motion to Reopen was vulnerable as number-barred, but proceeded to entertain it as resting on an implicit argument that country conditions in Ecuador had changed. This argument the BIA rejected because Muyubisnay\u2019s expert\u2019s supporting affidavit relied on facts in existence at the time of Muyubisnay\u2019s first hearing in 2010. Reaching the merits of Muyubisnay\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, the BIA found that Muyubisnay\u2019s prior counsel had adequately documented ethnic frictions in Ecuador during the original hearing. Finally, the BIA noted that Mu-yubisnay\u2019s new or renewed arguments did not remedy his seminal failure to articulate a fear of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\nMuyubisnay now timely appeals.\nII. Standard of Review\nWe review both the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and its denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. See Larngar v. Holder, 562 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.2009); Asemota v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 32, 34 (1st Cir.2005). We will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless a petitioner shows that the BIA committed an error of law or \u201cexercised its judgment in an arbitrary, capricious, or irrational way.\u201d Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir.2007).\nIII. Motion to Reconsider\n\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision.... \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 360 (1st Cir.2004). A party filing a motion to reconsider \u201cmust present additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked.\u201d Asemota, 420 F.3d at 33. \u201cThe purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to raise new facts, but to demonstrate that the BIA erred as a matter of law or fact.\u201d Zhang v. I.N.S., 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir.2003).\nTo qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must \u201cestablish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b); Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 85-86 (1st Cir.2007). Where an applicant has not suffered past persecution, he or she must demonstrate \u201cthat it is more likely than not\u201d that he or she would face persecution upon removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2); Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). A showing of persecution necessarily \u201cimplies some connection to government action or inaction.\u201d Lopez-Castro v. Holder, 577 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120-21 (1st Cir.2005)). However, conduct by private parties can support a finding of persecution if \u201cthere is some showing that the alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are not controllable by the government.\u201d Silva, 394 F.3d at 7.\nTo support withholding of removal, persecution by a private party whom a government refuses or fails to control must arise \u201con account of\u2019 one of the five statutorily enumerated grounds. See Ortiz-Araniba v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] petitioner must demonstrate ... a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\u201d (emphasis added)). For example, in Javed v. Holder, we found that an erroneous determination that a private party\u2019s death threats did not rise to the level of persecution \u201cwould be harmless if [the BIA] were correct that the persecution ... experienced was not \u2018on account of a protected ground.\u201d 715 F.3d 391, 396 (1st Cir.2013); see also Baghdasaryan v. Holder, 592 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cAn applicant alleging past persecution has the burden of establishing that ... the persecution was on account of one or more protected grounds; and ... the persecution was committed by ... forces that the government was unable or unwilling to control.\u201d); Fiadjoe v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., 411 F.3d 135, 160 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cTo establish persecution, an alien must show past or potential harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a statutorily enumerated ground that is committed ... by forces the government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d).\nThe BIA correctly found that Muyubisnay had failed to establish that Huillca\u2019s threats against his family arose \u201con the basis of\u2019 a protected ground. Even if it is true (as the BIA appears to have assumed) that the Ecuadorian police had refused to protect Muyubisnay\u2019s family from Huillca because of the family\u2019s indigenous ethnicity, this is not enough. Muyubisnay must also show that the violence threatened by Huillca itself originated \u201con account of\u2019 a protected characteristic. See Javed, 715 F.3d at 396. The undisputed evidence instead easily supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Huillca\u2019s threats were motivated by an acrimonious intra-family custody battle that had nothing to do with the family\u2019s indigenous status. See Lumanauw v. Mukasey, 510 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.2007) (finding that death threats issued during a custody battle could not constitute persecution absent any evidence \u201cthat petitioner\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s actions were motivated to any extent by petitioner\u2019s Christian beliefs\u201d). Persecution by a family member resulting from an intra-family conflict is not persecution on account of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b), and therefore is not a ground for withholding of removal.\nAlternately, Muyubisnay argues that Ecuador\u2019s systematic exclusion of indigenous communities from police protection amounts to state-sponsored \u201cencouragement\u201d of persecution. But to establish that the government of Ecuador\u2019s alleged encouragement of ethnic strife constitutes persecution under the INA, Muyubisnay would need show a pattern of state-sponsored violence that is so widespread that any member of an indigenous group would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d face persecution on that ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). While the BIA agreed that Muyubisnay had shown individual instances of discrimination against indigenous peoples in Ecuador, it supportably found no showing of systematic discrimination suggesting a state policy of deliberate persecution.\nIV. Second Motion to Reopen\nMuyubisnay next challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his Second Motion to Reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\nAs a general rule, motions to reopen removal hearings are disfavored as contrary to \u201cthe compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.\u201d Raza, 484 F.3d at 127 (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir.2005)). Accordingly, the INA places strict temporal and numerical limitations on a petitioner\u2019s ability to file a motion to reopen. A petitioner may normally file only one such motion within ninety days of the final administrative decision. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); Tandayu v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 97, 100 (1st Cir.2008). The statute recognizes only one formal exception to these procedural requirements: where the petitioner demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); Tandayu, 521 F.3d at 100.\nThis court has thus far declined to resolve whether the INA\u2019s procedural limitations are further subject to equitable tolling for exceptional circumstances such as ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir.2007) (\u201cThis court has not yet decided whether the BIA has either the authority or the obligation to excuse the late filings on the basis of equitable tolling.\u201d); Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir.2010) (assuming \u201carguendo ... that the time and number limits on motions to reopen are subject to equitable tolling\u201d). Nor does this case require us to reach the issue, because, simply on the merits, Muyubisnay has failed to satisfy the legal standard for a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\u201cBecause deportation proceedings are deemed to be civil, rather than criminal, in nature, petitioners have no constitutional right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Lozada v. I.N.S., 857 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1988). Notwithstanding, the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\u201d Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); see also Saakian v. I.N.S., 252 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2001). Ineffective assistance of counsel may violate a petitioner\u2019s right to due process where counsel\u2019s deficiencies render \u201cthe proceeding ... so fundamentally unfair that the alien [is] prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d Bernal-Vallejo v. I.N.S., 195 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.1999); see also Guerrero-Santana, 499 F.3d at 93. A petitioner bringing an ineffective assistance claim must establish both a deficient performance by counsel and \u201ca reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from [his] former representation.\u201d Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nMuyubisnay has failed to show that expert testimony regarding discrimination against indigenous peoples in Ecuador would have had a reasonable probability of altering the outcome of either his initial application for withholding or his First Motion to Reopen. While Muyubisnay claims that an expert witness would have \u201cprovided substantive corroboration\u201d of discriminatory conditions in Ecuador, the BIA did not discount Muyubisnay\u2019s argument that his family was being denied police protection. The expert\u2019s proffered assertion that Huillca\u2019s threats are \u201ca form of state-backed persecution of [Petitioner\u2019s] family because of their indigenous background\u201d is purely conclusory in content, and fails utterly to explain the connection between Huillca\u2019s personal venom and any official persecution \u201con the basis of\u2019 a protected ground. Because Muyubisnay did not carry his burden of demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his Second Motion to Reopen.\nV. Conclusion\nThe petition is DENIED.\n. In Ngengwe v. Mukasey, the principal case cited by Muyubisnay, the Eighth Circuit applied the same reasoning in finding that a claim of persecution based on private conduct could be sustained only if the private acts arose \"on account of\u201d a statutorily enumerated ground. 543 F.3d 1029, 1035, 1037 (8th Cir.2008).\n. While the BIA chose to construe Muyubis-nay's Second Motion to Reopen as incorporating an argument based on changed country conditions, Muyubisnay does not pursue the argument on appeal.",
