      {
        "text": "Per Curiam.\nIn Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992), this Court held that \u201cthe use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment [even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\u201d In this ease, the District Court dismissed a prisoner\u2019s excessive force claim based entirely on its determination that his injuries were \u201cde minimis.\u201d Because the District Court\u2019s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with Hudson\u2019s direction to decide excessive force claims based on the nature of the force rather than the extent of the injury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment is reversed.\nI\nIn March 2008, petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North Carolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina pursuant to Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979,42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Wilkins\u2019 pro se complaint alleged that, on June 13,2007, he was \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d assaulted \u201c[without any provocation\u201d by a corrections officer, respondent Gaddy. App. to Pet. for Cert. C-4. According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently angered by Wilkins\u2019 request for a grievance form, \u201csnatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto the concrete floor.\u201d Ibid. Gaddy \u201cthen proceeded to punch, kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to physically remove him from [Wilkins].\u201d Ibid. Wilkins further alleged that, \u201c[a]s a result of the excessive force used by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries including a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood pressure as well as migraine headaches and dizziness\u201d and \u201cpsychological trauma and mental anguish including depression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.\u201d Ibid.\nThe District Court, on its own motion and without a response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court stated that, \u201c[i]n order to state an excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish that he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d No. 3:08-cv-00138 (WDNC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp. 1, 2 (footnote omitted; citing Taylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v. Dorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc)). According to the eourt, Wilkins\u2019 alleged injuries were no more severe than those deemed de minimis in the Circuit\u2019s Taylor and Riley decisions. Indeed, the court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his injuries had required medical attention.\nIn a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment might prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been prescribed, and continued to take, medication for his headaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And he attached medical records purporting to corroborate his injuries and course of treatment.\nDescribing reconsideration as \u201c\u2018an extraordinary remedy,\u201d' the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No. 3:08-cv-00138. (WDNC, Aug. 25, 2008), p. 1. The medical records, the court observed, indicated that some of Wilkins\u2019 alleged injuries \u201cwere pre-existing conditions.\u201d Id., at 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pressure and mental health issues even before the assault. The court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray after the incident \u201cto examine his \u2018bruised heel,\u2019\u201d but it \u201cnote[d] that bruising is generally considered a de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d Id., at 4. The court similarly characterized as de minimis Wilkins\u2019 complaints of back pain and headaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his complaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Appeals affirmed \u201cfor the reasons stated by the district court.\u201d 308 Fed. Appx. 696, 697 (CA4 2009) (per curiam).\nII\nIn requiring what amounts to a showing of significant injury in order to state an excessive force claim, the Fourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this Court in Hudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner in Hudson filed suit under \u00a7 1983 alleging that corrections officers had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach without justification, resulting in \u201cminor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and lip\u201d as well as loosened teeth and a cracked partial dental plate. 503 U. S., at 4. A Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson\u2019s favor, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that an inmate must prove \u201ca significant injury\u201d in order to state an excessive force claim. Hudson v. McMillian, 929 F. 2d 1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam). According to the Court of Appeals, Hudson\u2019s injuries, which had not required medical attention, were too \u201cminor\u201d to warrant relief. Ibid.\nReversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the notion that \u201csignificant injury\u201d is a threshold requirement for stating an excessive force claim. The \u201ccore judicial inquiry,\u201d we held, was not whether a certain quantum of injury was sustained, but rather \u201cwhether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d 503 U. S., at 7; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319-321 (1986). \u201cWhen prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201ccontemporary standards of decency always are violated . . . whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\u201d Hudson, 503 U. S., at 9; see also id., at 13-14 (Black-mun, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cThe Court today appropriately puts to rest a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when coupled with \u2018significant injury,\u2019 e. g., injury that requires medical attention or leaves permanent marks\u201d).\nThis is not to say that the \u201cabsence of serious injury\u201d is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Id., at 7 (opinion of the Court). \u201c[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest \u2018whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary\u2019 in a particular situation.\u201d Ibid, (quoting Whitley, supra, at 321). The extent of injury may also provide some indication of the amount of force applied. As we stated in Hudson, not \u201cevery malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.\u201d 503 U. S., at 9. \u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de mini mis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d Id., at 9-10 (some internal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who complains of a \u201c\u2018push or shove\u2019\u201d that causes no discernible injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim. Id., at 9 (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028, 1033 (CA2 1973)).\nInjury and force, however, are only imperfectly correlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts. An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape without serious injury. Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that the supposedly \u201c \u2018minor\u2019 \u201d nature of the injuries \u201cprovide[d] no basis for dismissal of [Hudson\u2019s] \u00a71983 claim\u201d because \u201cthe blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are not de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.\u201d 503 U. S., at 10.\nThe allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite similar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Court\u2019s analysis closely resembles the approach Hudson disavowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked, kneed, choked, and body slammed \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d and \u201c[without any provocation.\u201d Dismissing Wilkins\u2019 action sua sponte, the District Court did not hold that this purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a bruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medical treatment, involved de minimis force. Instead, the court concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim because \u201che simply has not alleged that he suffered anything more than a de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d No. 3:08-cv-00138 (WDNC, Apr. 16, 2008), at 2.\nIn giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis nature of Wilkins\u2019 injuries, the District Court relied on two Fourth Circuit cases. See Riley, 115 F. 3d, at 1166-1168; Taylor, 155 F. 3d, at 483-485. Those cases, in turn, were based upon the Fourth Circuit\u2019s earlier decision in Norman v. Taylor, 25 F. 3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which approved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force. According to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson \u201cdoes not foreclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view . . . that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff cannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim if his injury is de minimis.\u201d 25 F. 3d, at 1263.\nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s strained reading of Hudson is not defensible. This Court\u2019s decision did not, as the Fourth Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury threshold for excessive force claims from \u201csignificant\u201d to \u201cnon-de minimis\u201d \u2014 whatever those ill-defined terms might mean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the \u201ccore judicial inquiry\u201d from the extent of the injury to the nature of the force\u2014 specifically, whether it was nontrivial and \u201cwas applied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d 503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did here, that the absence of \u201csome arbitrary quantity of injury\u201d requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id, at 9.\nIn holding that the District Court erred in dismissing Wilkins\u2019 complaint based on the supposedly de minimis nature of his injuries, we express no view on the -underlying merits of his excessive force claim. In order to prevail, Wilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the assault actually occurred but also that it was carried out \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d rather than as part of \u201ca good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\u201d Id., at 7. Moreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest nature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the damages he may recover.\n* * *\nThe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nThe materials in the record do not disclose Gaddy\u2019s full name.\nMost Circuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de minimis injury requirement. See, e. g., Wright v. Goord, 554 F. 3d 255, 269-270 (CA2 2009) (\u201c[O]ur Court has reversed summary dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of injury was slight____ [T]he absence of any significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment inquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of such injury if the defendant\u2019s use of force was malicious or sadistic\u201d); Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648-649 (CA3 2002) (\u201c[T]he Eighth Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . . [D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force\u201d); Oliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view \u201cthat to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical injury\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee, 439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).\nThe Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. See, e. g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163 F. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (\u201c[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical injury\u201d). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d 384, 386 (2006) (\u201cThis Court has never directly held that injuries must reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force claim\u201d). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have survived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court\u2019s precedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-cfe minimis. See, e. g., ibid, (permitting a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment excessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that the prisoner suffered \u201cone-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee and left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left thumb,\u201d as well as \u201cback problems\u201d); Gomez, supra, at 922 (refusing to grant summary judgment on de minimis injury grounds where the prisoner alleged \u201cphysical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts, scrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body\u201d).",

        "text": "Justice Thomas,\nwith whom Justice Scalia joins, concurring in the judgment.\nI agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s Eighth Amendment analysis is inconsistent with Hudson v. McMil lian, 503 U. S. 1(1992). But I continue to believe that Hudson was wrongly decided. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007) (dissenting opinion); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 858 (1994) (opinion concurring in judgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993) (dissenting opinion); Hudson, supra, at 17 (dissenting opinion).\n\u201cAt the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the word \u2018punishment\u2019 referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of a crime.\u201d Helling, supra, at 38 (Thomas, J., dissenting). The Court adhered to this understanding until 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause also extends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a criminal sentence. See generally Hudson, supra, at 18-20 (Thomas, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expansion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new interpretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to every deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should apply \u201conly [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving \u2018serious\u2019 injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a culpable state of mind.\u201d Hudson, supra, at 20 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).\nHudson, however, discarded the requirement of serious injury. Building upon Estelle's mislaid foundation, the Court concluded that force, rather than injury, is the relevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges excessive force at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing more than de minimis injury can state a claim under the Eighth Amendment. Hudson thus turned the Eighth Amendment into \u201ca National Code of Prison Regulation,\u201d 503 U. S., at 28 (Thomas, J., dissenting); Farmer, 511 U. S., at 859 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), with \u201cfederal judges [acting as] superintendents of prison conditions nationwide,\u201d id., at 860. Although neither the Constitution nor our precedents require this result, no party to this case asks us to overrule Hudson. Accordingly, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.",
