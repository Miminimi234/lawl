        "text": "The petitioner, Ronald Ballard, appeals from a judgment of a single justice of this court denying his petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We affirm.\nIn connection with his petition for discharge from a sexually dangerous person commitment pursuant to G. L. c. 123 A, \u00a7 9, Ballard sought and received funds in the Superior Court for the purposes of retaining an independent examiner, pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27C. He thereafter filed a motion for supplemental funds that was allowed in part and denied in part. Ballard then, properly, sought review of the judge\u2019s ruling from a single justice of the Appeals Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D. After the single justice affirmed the judge\u2019s order, Ballard filed a \u201cNotice of Appeal to the Full Panel.\u201d The Appeals Court struck the notice on the basis that no appeal can be taken from the review by a single justice, pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, of an action initially taken by the trial court. See Hurley v. Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, 424 Mass. 1008, 1009 (1997) (Hurley). See also Hunt v. Appeals Court, 444 Mass. 460, 463 n. 2 (2005). While Ballard\u2019s appeal to the single justice was pending, the trial judge allowed his G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, petition, and he was discharged. He continued to pursue his request for fees, however, apparently because he is seeking payment of fees for services already performed prior to any court authorization. After the Appeals Court struck his notice of appeal, Ballard filed his G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition in the county court.\nIn his petition, Ballard asserted that because he succeeded in the trial court, there would be no direct appeal, and, therefore, \u201cno other method to review the judge\u2019s order\u201d denying funds other than a petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice denied the petition, and the case is now before us pursuant to SJ.C. Rule 2:21, as amended, 434 Mass. 1301 (2001), which requires a showing that \u201creview of the trial court decision cannot adequately be obtained on appeal from any final adverse judgment in the trial court or by other available means.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 2:21 (2). Ballard has not made, and cannot make, such a showing. Although he suggests that if his petition for discharge had been denied he could have pressed his claim for payment of funds in his direct appeal, he is mistaken. General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 27D, \u201cplainly states that the decision of the single justice of the Appeals Court [reviewing a judge\u2019s denial of funds] \u2018shall be final with respect to such request.\u2019 \u201d Hurley, supra at 1009, and cases cited. Review was available to Ballard under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D. He sought and received such review, and he is not entitled to anything further. \u201cRarely should we employ our superintendence power to review rulings in matters in which the Legislature has expressly stated that the decision of another court or judge \u2018shall be final.\u2019 \u201d Id.\nThe case was submitted on the papers filed, accompanied by a memorandum of law.\nEric Tennen for the petitioner.\nThe single justice did not err or abuse his discretion in denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.\nJudgment affirmed.\nTo the extent that the judge denied the motion, he did so because Ballard was seeking funds for services already performed, without prior authorization.",
