        "text": "NATHANIEL R. JONES, Circuit Judge.\nIn this case, Defendant-Appellant Dana Ray Morrison pled guilty to receipt and possession of a firearm by a felon. Sentenced under the federal guidelines, he appeals the disallowance of two mitigating factors, possession of a firearm solely for sport and acceptance of responsibility, that would have reduced the sentence imposed. Though the district court's finding that the firearm was not used solely for sporting purposes is not clearly erroneous, we vacate the sentence and remand for resen-tencing since the finding that Morrison had not accepted responsibility was based, at least in part, on inappropriate considerations.\nI. The Case\nMorrison was convicted on August 30, 1988, of two felonies. On November 30, 1990, he was found in possession of a loaded, six-inch, Rossi .357 Magnum revolver that he had purchased on September 1, 1990. On May 14, 1991, he was indicted for receipt and possession of a firearm by a felon in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (1988).\nOn July 19, 1991, Defendant entered a plea agreement with the government. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee accepted this agreement on December 16, 1991, at which time it imposed a sentence of twenty-two months, followed by three years of supervised release, and a fine of $1,800. The prison sentence was within the range established by the United States Sentencing Commission in its Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1991) [hereinafter Guidelines].\nDefendant sought a reduction in sentence on the basis that: (1) the firearm was used solely for lawful sporting purposes, see Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2); and (2) he had accepted responsibility for his actions, see Guidelines \u00a7 3E1.1. The court rejected Defendant\u2019s arguments. Defendant timely appealed, claiming that the court should have granted him the reductions.\nII. Standard of Review\nA. Generally\nAppellate review of sentences under the federal sentencing guidelines is generally governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (1988):\n(e) Consideration. \u2014 Upon review of the record, the court of appeals shall determine whether the sentence\u2014\n(1) was imposed in violation of law;\n(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines;\n(3) is outside the applicable guideline range, and is unreasonable ...\nThe court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and shall give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\nB. The \u201cSolely for Sporting Purposes\u201d Issue\nDetermination of whether the .357 Magnum in this case was used solely for sporting purposes is a question of fact and as such is to be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. See United States v. Lorenzo, 951 F.2d 350 (6th Cir.1991).\nC. The Acceptance of Responsibility Issue\nRegarding acceptance of responsibility, the standard of review is discussed in Application Note Five to Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(a):\nThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\nSee United States v. Wilson, 878 F.2d 921, 923 (6th Cir.1989) (accepting and applying this standard). Generally a question of fact, the trial court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility normally enjoys the protection of the clearly erroneous standard, and will not be overturned unless it is without foundation. See id. (citing and accepting relevant portion of United States v. Thomas, 870 F.2d 174, 176 (5th Cir.1989)); United States v. Lassiter, 929 F.2d 267, 270 (6th Cir.1991); United States v. Christoph, 904 F.2d 1036, 1041 (6th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1041, 111 S.Ct. 713, 112 L.Ed.2d 702 (1991).\nQuestions of law, however, such as the appropriate application of this guideline to a particular set of facts, are subject to de novo review. See United States v. Wilson, 920 F.2d 1290, 1294 (6th Cir.1990); United States v. Brewer, 899 F.2d 503, 506 (6th Cir.1990).\nIII. The \u201cSolely for Sporting Purposes\" Reduction\nIn support of his claim that the firearm was used solely for sporting purposes, Defendant presents the following facts. First, before purchasing the handgun, Defendant allegedly had a discussion with Joe Castle, who issued Defendant a hunting license, concerning what type of handgun could be used for hunting. Defendant claims that he followed Castle\u2019s suggestion in purchasing a .357 revolver. Second, he was found in possession of the gun shortly after an alleged hunting trip (during deer hunting season) with Marcus Vanhooser. Defendant asserts that about forty to forty-five minutes after their hunting expedition, they stopped at a car wash to clean the truck owned by Vanhooser. Police stopped the truck because Vanhooser was driving with a suspended license. A pat-down search for weapons of the two individuals revealed the .357 revolver in question on the Defendant\u2019s person.\nThe government counters with the following facts. First, the handgun had no scope. Second, the gun was found loaded in a concealed shoulder holster. Third, according to the police report, the stop of the truck and the arrest of Defendant took place at 10:00 p.m., about four to five hours after nightfall. Fourth, at the time of the arrest, Defendant claimed not to have been hunting, but to have been working on the truck just prior to the arrest. Fifth, no hunting paraphernalia was ever found in the truck or on Defendant's person. Sixth, Vanhooser, the purported hunting companion, was not in possession of any firearm.\nThe trial court\u2019s determination that Defendant did not possess the .357 revolver solely for sporting (hunting) purposes is not clearly erroneous. As a preliminary matter, Defendant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a reduction in the guidelines offense level is warranted. United States v. Rodriguez, 896 F.2d 1031, 1033 (6th Cir.1990); United States v. Potter, 956 F.2d 1164 (6th Cir.1992). Thus, the government need not prove that the revolver was used for illegal purposes. Rather, Defendant must prove that the firearm was used solely for sporting purposes.\nIn making the factual determination whether the gun was used solely for sporting purposes, Application Note 10 under Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) directs the trial court to look to the surrounding circumstances, which include: \u201cthe number and type of firearms, the amount and type of ammunition, [and] the location and circumstances of possession and actual use.... \u201d In this case, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that a Rossi .357 Magnum, without a scope, carried in concealed fashion in a shoulder holster, is not possessed \u201csolely for lawful sporting purposes or collection.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2). Though Defendant maintained he would not have even used the weapon in self-defense, the trial court could properly weigh the credibility of Defendant\u2019s contentions against him in reaching the factual conclusion from the surrounding circumstances that the gun. was not possessed solely for the purposes of hunting. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (1988).\nFurthermore, it is not clearly erroneous to assume that Defendant was not hunting immediately prior to his arrest. Defendant\u2019s credibility on this issue was called into question when he stated that he was arrested about forty to forty-five minutes after he and Yanhooser finished hunting. The police report puts the time of arrest at about 10:00 p.m. \u2014 four to five hours after sunset. This fact puts an obvious strain on Defendant\u2019s story, unless he possessed an infrared scope, which he did not. It is not unreasonable to believe the police report over and above Defendant\u2019s testimony, particularly since no hunting equipment was found in the truck or on Defendant\u2019s person, and since Vanhooser, his hunting partner, did not have a gun at the time of the arrest.\nThe fact that no evidence was presented to refute the allegation that Defendant only used the .357 Magnum for hunting purposes does not upset the trial court\u2019s conclusion. In weighing Defendant\u2019s credibility against reasonable inferences from the facts presented, the trial court reached a conclusion that is not clearly erroneous.\nIV. The Acceptance of Responsibility Reduction\nRegarding Defendant's claim that he accepted responsibility for his actions, he asserts that he was candid about his actions, was cooperative with the authorities, and pleaded guilty.\nThe government responds with the fact that, subsequent to Defendant\u2019s release on a $10,000 property bond in this ease, he was arrested for attempting to steal a pickup truck. Furthermore, a probation officer found him in constructive possession of other firearms. The weapons were found in plain view at Defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house, which was Defendant\u2019s residence. Lastly, Defendant tested positive for the controlled substance, benzodiazepine.\nThe trial court has the responsibility to determine whether a defendant has met his or her burden of showing acceptance of responsibility by a preponderance of the evidence. See Lassiter, 929 F.2d at 270; Rodriguez, 896 F.2d at 1032. The Guidelines list \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations\u201d as a factor to be considered in determining whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. Guidelines \u00a7 3E1.1, Application Note 1(a). A probation officer found Defendant in constructive possession of other firearms (including a fully operational shotgun) after arraignment. It was appropriate for the trial court to weigh this against Morrison in determining whether he had accepted responsibility.\nThe district court also counted Morrison\u2019s attempted theft as a factor against him, and may have also counted the positive drug test against him. This poses the question whether criminal activity committed after indictment/information but before sentencing, which is wholly distinct from the crime(s) for which a defendant is being sentenced, can be properly considered when determining whether a two-level acceptance of responsibility reduction is in order. Some might argue that a defendant can recognize and affirm acceptance of personal responsibility for certain criminal activity while engaging in other criminal activity. On the other hand, it might be argued that one who has truly accepted responsibility for a crime against society will not commit further crimes, period. The former view analyzes acceptance of responsibility on a case-by-case basis, while the latter view understands it to apply to the defendant\u2019s entire criminal disposition \u2014 either the defendant is no longer of a criminal disposition, or he still is.\nFederal case law does not provide substantial support for either point of view. Appellee cites two cases to support the proposition that \u201ccontinuing criminal activity [of any sort] by the defendant makes the acceptance of responsibility reduction inappropriate\u201d: Lassiter, and United States v. Snyder, 913 F.2d 300 (6th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1039, 111 S.Ct. 709, 112 L.Ed.2d 698 (1991). In both of these cases, however, the \u201ccontinuing criminal activity\u201d was of the same type as the underlying offense. To the same effect is the Sixth Circuit case of United States v. Reed, 951 F.2d 97 (6th Cir.1991), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1700, 118 L.Ed.2d 409 (1992), where we affirmed the district court\u2019s refusal to give an acceptance of responsibility reduction. In that case, the defendant, while in jail pending sentencing for credit card fraud, engaged in further fraud from a jail telephone. See also United States v. Jessup, 966 F.2d 1354, 1356 (10th Cir.1992) (acceptance of responsibility reduction denied where defendant, who had been arrested and indicted under the Mann Act, \u201ccontinued [his] behavior of sexually molesting young boys\u201d while out on bond); United States v. Olvera, 954 F.2d 788, 793 (2d Cir.) (acceptance of responsibility reduction denied, in part, where defendant, who was convicted of conspiring to distribute a controlled substance, smuggled a controlled substance into the prison where he was awaiting sentencing), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 3011, 120 L.Ed.2d 885 (1992); United States v. Cooper, 912 F.2d 344, 345-48 (9th Cir.1990) (acceptance of responsibility reduction denied where defendant, charged with fraud, became involved in additional fraudulent activity); United States v. Wivell, 893 F.2d 156, 158-59 (8th Cir.1990) (acceptance of responsibility reduction denied where defendant, charged with attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, dealt in cocaine while he was on bond awaiting disposition of the case).\nCourts have also upheld district court denials of an acceptance of responsibility reduction which look to criminal conduct related to, but not of the same type, as the underlying offense. See, e.g., United States v. Barrett, 890 F.2d 855, 868-69 (6th Cir.1989) (acceptance of responsibility denied where defendant threatened government informant and witness); United States v. Davis, 878 F.2d 1299, 1300-01 (11th Cir.) (acceptance of responsibility reduction denied where defendant, charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, continued to use drugs while out on bond), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989); United States v. Scroggins, 880 F.2d 1204, 1215 (11th Cir.1989) (acceptance of responsibility reduction denied where defendant, charged with postal theft, \u201chad not turned away from the lifestyle that had motivated his offense of conviction,\u201d viz., cocaine use), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1083, 110 S.Ct. 1816, 108 L.Ed.2d 946 (1990).\nAnd courts will uphold denials of an acceptance of responsibility reduction where the pre-sentencing criminal conduct is both of the same type and otherwise related to the underlying offense. See, e.g., United States v. Jordan, 890 F.2d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.1989) (acceptance of responsibility denied where defendant, charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, participated in two separate instances of drug dealing, and used cocaine, while awaiting sentencing).\nAt least one case is directly on point. In United States v. Watkins, 911 F.2d 983 (5th Cir.1990), the Fifth Circuit reviewed a case where the defendant, having pled guilty to passing forged treasury checks and to possessing treasury checks stolen from the mail, used cocaine while on release pending sentencing. The district court refused to grant the defendant an acceptance of responsibility reduction solely because of the drug use. See id. at 984. The Fifth Circuit, noting that \u201cthere is no direct basis for this interpretation [of the acceptance of responsibility criterion] in the Guidelines themselves or in case law,\u201d yet upheld the district court\u2019s ruling. Id. It concluded that the district court\u2019s view was not clearly erroneous because Application Note 1(a) \u201cis phrased in general terms and does not specify that the defendant need only refrain from criminal conduct associated with the offense of conviction in order to qualify for the reduction.\u201d Id. at 985; see also United States v. O\u2019Neil, 936 F.2d 599, 600-01 (1st Cir.1991) (seeming to accept proposition that any criminal conduct shows lack of remorse and thus lack of acceptance of responsibility for crime charged).\nIn contrast to Watkins (and O\u2019Neil), we consider \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct\u201d to refer to that conduct which is related to the underlying offense. Such conduct may be of the same type as the underlying offense, as in Lassiter, Snyder, Reed, Jessup, Olvera, Cooper, Wivell, and Jordan; or may be the motivating force behind the underlying offense, as in Scroggins; or may be related to actions toward government witnesses concerning the underlying offense, as in Barrett; or may involve an otherwise strong link with the underlying offense, as in Davis and Jordan. We are persuaded by the rationale that an individual may be truly repentant for one crime yet commit other unrelated crimes.\nThe opposing rationale was adopted in the dissent to the instant case, which reads, in part: \u201cThe issue appears to be whether the questioned conduct \u2018is inconsistent\u2019 with defendant\u2019s statement that I realize I have done what I should not have done\u2014 engage in illegal conduct.\u201d We would end the sentence, \u201c... \u2014 be a felon in possession of a firearm.\u201d We hold that acceptance of responsibility, as contemplated by the United States Sentencing Commission, is \u201cacceptance of responsibility for his offense, \u201d Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(a) (Nov. 1992) (emphasis added), not for \u201cillegal conduct\u201d generally. Considering unrelated criminal conduct unfairly penalizes a defendant for a criminal disposition, when true remorse for specific criminal behavior is the issue.\nIn sum, since the district court did consider an inappropriate factor (and may have considered another) in deciding whether Morrison had accepted responsibility for the firearms violation, we VACATE the sentence, and REMAND the case for resen-tencing so that the district court may properly weigh the factors that remain.\n. We note that Section 3El.l(a) was recently amended, effective November 1, 1992. Section 3El.l(a) previously read: \"If a defendant clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for his criminal conduct, reduce the offense level by 2 levels.\u201d It now reads: \"If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.\u201d While we do not necessarily interpret this amendment as a change from a \"criminal disposition\" rationale to a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d rationale, we find that it helps clarify the issue in a manner that supports our point of view.",

        "text": "KENNEDY, Circuit Judge,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI concur in the court\u2019s opinion with the exception of the reversal of the District Court\u2019s finding that defendant had not demonstrated an acceptance of personal responsibility for his criminal conduct. I disagree with the panel\u2019s interpretation of the purpose of the Acceptance of Responsibility Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and limitations it places on what behavior may be considered by a district court in applying that Guideline. The panel prohibits the District Court from considering post-arrest, post-guilty plea criminal behavior not similar or related to the crime for which a defendant is convicted. This presupposes that the \u201clegitimate societal interests\u201d referred to in the Background Application Note to section 3E1.1, are limited to encouraging a defendant not to commit the same or similar crimes. In my view, that is too cramped a reading of the purposes of encouraging acceptance of responsibility by criminal defendants. It should be open to the sentencing court to conclude that defendants who fail to live within the law after arrest, and especially after they plead guilty or have agreed to plead guilty, have not accepted responsibility for their criminal actions.\nThe first consideration in favor of a defendant qualifying for accepting responsibility is \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations.\u201d Application Note 1(a) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. This is broadly written. United States v. Watkins, 911 F.2d 983 (5th Cir.1990) (section 3E1.1 is \u201cphrased in general terms\u201d). It does not include the word \u201crelated\u201d before the phrase \u201ccriminal conduct,\u201d which could quite easily have been done had that been the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intent. Instead, the clear import of the language is to include all criminal conduct and associations. Inclusion of \u201cassociations\u201d as well as conduct corroborates this broad interpretation. By including consideration of whether a defendant continues relationships with criminal confederates, the Sentencing Commission was going beyond limited consideration of whether a defendant was continuing the same or similar criminal conduct.\nWhen the Background Application Note does refer to \u201crelated conduct,\u201d it does so in defining the conduct for which a defendant is to have accepted responsibility, not in limiting what behavior a sentencing court may consider to determine whether responsibility has been accepted. On the whole, the Commission indicates little limitation on what considerations are legitimate in granting the acceptance of responsibility reduction. The Commission took great pains, especially in the amendment effective November 1,1991, to indicate that a defendant\u2019s decision not to plead guilty should not in all cases prohibit the reduction. Other than that, section 3E1.1 is written inclusively. The list of considerations in Application Note 1 explicitly states that it is \u201cnot limited to\u201d the factors enumerated. The last sentence of Application Note 3 lends additional support to my conclusion. Truthful admission of guilt is significant evidence of acceptance. \u201cHowever, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d The issue appears to be whether the questioned conduct \u201cis inconsistent\u201d with defendant\u2019s statement that I realize I have done what I should not have done \u2014 engage in illegal conduct. To continue to engage in other illegal conduct puts the lie to the statement. The only other possible limitation on what may be considered under 3E1.1 is found in the Background Application Note parenthetical which might be read to limit the behavior which may be considered to that listed in Application Note 1 and \u201cequivalent action.\u201d This is hardly a limitation, and certainly not one which eliminates unrelated criminal conduct from consideration, especially when the first listed factor is \u201cwithdrawal from criminal conduct.\u201d\nThis is not to say a murderer caught stealing gum cannot receive the acceptance of responsibility reduction. It is simply to state that a district court might or might not find the theft of chewing gum in particular circumstances illuminative of whether the murderer has accepted responsibility for her actions. I believe such a determination should rest with the district court. Under Application Note 5 the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference, and nothing in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 makes unrelated criminal conduct an impermissible consideration.\nThus, in the present case, when in denying the acceptance of responsibility reduction to defendant the District Court considered his attempted theft and use of a controlled substance, it acted within its discretion under the Guidelines. I would AFFIRM.",
