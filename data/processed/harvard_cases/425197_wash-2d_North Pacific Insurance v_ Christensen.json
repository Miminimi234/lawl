        "text": "Ireland, J.\nIn this case, we must determine whether a passenger who causes an accident by unexpectedly grabbing the steering wheel of a motor vehicle is the operator of that vehicle for purposes of underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. We hold that, under the facts of this case, the passenger assumed physical control of the vehicle. Therefore, the passenger was the operator of the vehicle for purposes of the UIM provisions of this particular policy.\nFACTS\nRobert Christensen, a 16-year-old student, was driving his family\u2019s car in traffic when Christensen\u2019s high school friend, Christopher Chase, reached over from the front passenger seat and grabbed the steering wheel. Chase caused the car to swerve across the center line and to collide with an oncoming vehicle. Christensen and others were injured in the collision. Chase was found guilty in juvenile court of vehicular assault.\nAt the time of the collision, Christensen was insured under a North Pacific Insurance Company (North Pacific) automobile policy issued to his parents, James and Pamela Farmer. The policy provided liability and underinsured motorist coverage. The limits of the liability coverage were exhausted to satisfy the claims of others injured in the accident.\nChristensen submitted a UIM claim under this policy seeking to recover damages for his injuries on the grounds that Chase was the \u201coperator\u201d of the vehicle at the time of the collision, and therefore was an underinsured motorist.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nChristensen requested arbitration of his UIM claim as an insured under the UIM coverage of the Farmers\u2019 North Pacific policy. North Pacific stated that Christensen \u201cwas insured under the policy by virtue of being a family member of the named insured.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 161. However, North Pacific denied coverage on the basis that Chase was neither the owner nor operator of the car in which he was traveling at the time of the accident. North Pacific asserts that Chase\u2019s action of grabbing the steering wheel did not make him an \u201coperator\u201d of the vehicle under the insuring clause of the North Pacific policy.\nChristensen continued to assert a right to coverage. North Pacific then filed a declaratory judgment action in King County Superior Court, seeking a declaration that there was no coverage of Christensen\u2019s UIM claim under North Pacific\u2019s policy and that North Pacific, therefore, had no duty to pay benefits with respect to the claim.\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted Christensen\u2019s motion, holding that Christensen\u2019s UIM claim was covered under North Pacific\u2019s policy. The trial court held that Chase was the operator of the vehicle, \u201ceven though Chase was not operating the vehicle with permission or with full control, or apparently with any common sense.\u201d CP at 215. The trial court entered judgment granting attorney fees and costs to Christensen pursuant to Olympic Steamship Co. v. Centennial Insurance Co., 117 Wn.2d 37, 811 P.2d 673 (1991).\nNorth Pacific appealed, arguing that the plain and unambiguous meaning of \u201coperator\u201d within the terms of its policy provision is the driver, and a passenger who grabs the steering wheel is merely interfering with the driver\u2019s operation of the car. The Court of Appeals agreed, reversed the trial court, and remanded to that court to grant summary judgment for North Pacific. N. Pac. Ins. Co. v. Christensen, 95 Wn. App. 447, 453-54, 975 P.2d 552 (1999).\nThis Court granted Christensen\u2019s petition for review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\nANALYSIS\nStandard of Review\nWhen reviewing an order for summary judgment, an appellate court engages in the same inquiry as the trial court. Mountain Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Tydings, 125 Wn.2d 337, 341, 883 P.2d 1383 (1994). Summary judgment is properly granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Clements v. Travelers Indem. Co., 121 Wn.2d 243, 249, 850 P.2d 1298 (1993). All facts and reasonable inferences are considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Taggart v. State, 118 Wn.2d 195, 199, 822 P.2d 243 (1992). Questions of law are reviewed de novo. Mountain Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n, 125 Wn.2d at 341.\nIn the instant case, no material facts are in dispute. Thus, this Court decides whether a passenger who grabs the steering wheel is the \u201coperator\u201d of the vehicle for purposes of North Pacific\u2019s UIM policy language purely as a matter of law.\nStatutory and Insurance Policy Language\nWashington\u2019s UIM statute requires automobile insurance policies to insure \u201cagainst loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death, or property damage, suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. . . .\u201d RCW 48.22.030(2). Such policies must provide coverage \u201cfor the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles, hit-and-run motor vehicles, and phantom vehicles because of bodily injury, death, or property damage . . . Id. (emphasis added).\nThe UIM provision of the North Pacific policy reads as follows:\nWe will pay damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle because of:\n1. Bodily injury sustained by an insured and caused by an accident.\nCP at 129 (emphasis added).\nAs is shown above, North Pacific\u2019s policy language tracks the UIM statute. However, neither the statute nor the provision at issue defines the term \u201coperator.\u201d Consequently, the case turns on the definition of this term.\nThe Meaning of \u201cOperator\u201d\nThe interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co. v. Emerson, 102 Wn.2d 477, 480, 687 P.2d 1139 (1984). Undefined terms in an insurance policy \u201cmust be given a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given by an average insurance purchaser.\u201d Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Henault, 128 Wn.2d 207, 213, 905 P.2d 379 (1995).\n\u201cThe terms of the policy must be understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.\u201d Farmers Ins. Co. v. Miller, 87 Wn.2d 70, 73, 549 P.2d 9 (1976). \u201cTo determine the ordinary meaning of an undefined term, our courts look to standard English language dictionaries.\u201d Boeing Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 113 Wn.2d 869, 877, 784 P.2d 507 (1990).\nThe Court of Appeals, applying the rule that courts may rely on the dictionary to determine the ordinary meaning of an undefined term, looked to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1581 (1969):\n\u201cOperator\u201d is defined as \u201cone that produces a physical effect or engages himself in the mechanical aspect of any process or activity as . . . [a] driver.\u201d A driver is \u201ca person in actual physical control of a vehicle,\u201d and control means the \u201cpower or authority to guide or manage.\u201d\nChristensen, 95 Wn. App. at 451-52 (footnotes omitted) (alteration in original).\nThe Court of Appeals then followed by stating that an operator is \u201cthe person who controls all the critical functions of operating a car\u2014the ignition, accelerator, brake, and steering.\u201d Id. at 452. However, an \u201coperator\u201d is not solely the person occupying the driver\u2019s seat, but rather is anyone who is \u201cin actual physical control of a vehicle,\u201d having the \u201cpower to guide\u201d it. The appellate court inserted unwarranted restrictions based on its own perception of what the \u201caverage insurance consumer\u201d would understand. Id. While the appellate court correctly relies on the dictionary definitions, those definitions contain no suggestion that an \u201coperator\u201d must be a single person who is in command of all the controls of a car.\nThe flaw in the appellate court\u2019s analysis is also apparent in its subsequent observation:\nWhile we agree that one who grabs the steering wheel usurps for an instant one part of operating a car, he is at most interfering with the driver\u2019s ability to completely control the car and is not in actual physical control of it.\nId. at 452.\nThe dictionary definitions do not impose limits on the \u201cpurpose, extent, or duration\u201d of an operator\u2019s control over a vehicle. The appellate court erroneously includes restrictions as to purpose (one who \u201cusurps\u201d the wheel is \u201cinterfering with the driver\u2019s ability to completely control the car\u201d), extent (\u201call the critical functions of operating a car\u201d), and duration (\u201cfor an instant\u201d). The ordinary meanings do not support such restrictions.\nNorth Pacific argues that the customary meaning of a car\u2019s operator is the driver. While this meaning may be appropriate in common situations, Christensen responds that automobile insurance should also \u201cafford protection for the broad range of unusual events that can occur to injure people during the operation of motor vehicles.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 6.\nFrom a practical standpoint, narrowing the scope of \u201coperator\u201d to a single person who is in sole command of all the controls of a vehicle does not sufficiently address the real-life situations that arise while driving. Auto mishaps rarely result when drivers are in total control of all of the functions of their cars. Instead, accidents occur when there are failures to maintain complete control, including when a passenger unexpectedly grabs the steering wheel. Accidents can happen almost instantaneously\u2014when only one of the car\u2019s critical controls is compromised.\nHere, Chase did not merely interfere with Christensen\u2019s driving\u2014he took actual physical control of the car himself. When Chase suddenly grabbed the steering wheel, he became the operator of the vehicle in which he had been a passenger. Although Christensen was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, he became powerless to control the car. Chase assumed control of the steering mechanism long enough to cause the collision and resulting injuries.\nFor purposes of North Pacific\u2019s UIM policy provision, the term \u201coperator\u201d should be defined as \u201ca person who is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\u201d \u201cOperator\u201d reasonably includes a passenger who grabs the steering wheel of a moving car.\nThis interpretation is consistent with two Washington cases that have dealt with \u201cwheel grabbing.\u201d\nIn the first case, Viking Insurance Co. v. Zinkgraf, 47 Wn. App. 645, 737 P.2d 268 (1987), Mr. Zinkgraf was a front seat passenger who \u201cunexpectedly grabbed the steering wheel causing the car to leave the road and strike a tree.\u201d Id. at 645-46. The driver sued Zinkgraf for personal injuries and property damage. In order for the driver to recover under Zinkgraf\u2019s automobile insurance policy, Zinkgraf had to be found to have used or driven the car with the owner\u2019s permission. Although coverage was denied due to lack of permission, the court\u2019s analysis of \u201cusing\u201d the car is consistent with our definition of \u201coperating\u201d: \u201cThe term \u2018use\u2019 in an automobile insurance policy has been defined as \u2018[a]ny exercise of control over the vehicle . . . regardless of its purpose, extent, or duration.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 647 (quoting 12 George J. Couch, Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 45:64 (Ronald A. Anderson & Mark S. Rhodes, 2d rev. ed. 1981)).\nThe facts of the second case, In re Arambul, 37 Wn. App. 805, 683 P.2d 1123 (1984), are remarkably similar to the case at issue. In this second case, the teenage passenger, Rose Arambul, caused a fatal accident when she grabbed the steering wheel and caused the car she was riding in to cross the center line and collide with an oncoming car. Id. at 806. Miss Arambul was charged with negligent homicide by means of a motor vehicle under former RCW 46.61.520 (1975); the statute applied to persons who caused death \u201c \u2018by the operation of any vehicle in a reckless manner or with disregard for the safety of others.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 807 (quoting former RCW 46.61.520). The statutory definition of \u201coperator,\u201d for purposes of the crime, is \u201c \u2018every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting RCW 46.04.370).\nMiss Arambul argued that she was not the operator of the vehicle \u201cbecause she had no control of the gas, brake, or gearshift, and only split-second contact with the steering wheel.\u201d Id. at 807.\nAfter noting that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the statutory language indicates that \u201coperator\u201d is intended to include persons who are not necessarily drivers, the Arambul court reasoned as follows:\nThe ordinary meaning of the term \u201cactual physical control\u201d is \u201cexisting\u201d or \u201cpresent bodily restraint, directing influence, domination or regulation.\u201d Miss Arambul\u2019s acts fall within this definition .... The fact Miss Arambul did not have access to the accelerator or brakes did not affect her \u201cinfluence, dominion, or regulation\u201d of the vehicle. The momentary duration of this dominion is insignificant; for that instant in time she directed the path of the automobile and caused the death of another.\nId. at 808 (citations omitted).\nThe court held \u201cthat Miss Arambul\u2019s momentary grabbing of the steering wheel of the vehicle in which she was riding comes within the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018actual physical control.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 808.\nIn the instant case, Chase\u2019s momentary control of the steering wheel was likewise sufficient to cause Christensen\u2019s car to cross the center line, to collide with an oncoming car, and to result in injuries.\nIt is argued that the statutory definition of \u201coperator\u201d should be disregarded because it was enacted for purposes of determining criminal conduct, not insurance coverage. Rather, the insurer would have us resort to guessing what the \u201caverage insurance consumer\u201d would understand \u201coperator\u201d to mean. This argument is weak. A written definition by statute is clearly superior to supposition concerning the \u201caverage insurance consumer\u2019s\u201d understanding. The fact that the definition is for purposes of a criminal statute actually enhances its value, for a person\u2019s liberty may depend upon it.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the context of this case, the term \u201coperator\u201d is not ambiguous; it is merely undefined by North Pacific in its policy. When the term is given its usual and ordinary meaning according to dictionary definitions, an \u201coperator\u201d is a person who is in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a vehicle. This meaning is also consistent with other Washington cases, the Motor Vehicle Code, and public policy.\nWhile the passenger, Chase, did not have sole and continuous control of all the car\u2019s functions, he was in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the steering mechanism long enough to cause a collision and resulting injuries. Therefore, Chase is an \u201coperator\u201d of Christensen\u2019s vehicle for purposes of North Pacific\u2019s UIM policy provisions.\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting Christensen\u2019s summary judgment motion and its judgment granting fees and costs to Christensen. We award attorney fees on appeal to Christensen pursuant to RAP 18.1.\nSmith, Sanders, and Bridge, JJ., and Guy, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nAccording to the backseat passenger, Waldemar Tarasewicz, before Chase grabbed the steering wheel, Christensen had been swerving the car back and forth \u201ctrying to scare us.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 93. Christensen admitted swerving, but said that he stayed in the lane and \u201chad total control.\u201d CP at 118. Tarasewicz said the car was going straight when Chase grabbed the wheel.\nThe parties agree that Christensen\u2019s award of fees and costs is dependent upon how the insurance coverage issue is resolved on appeal.\nThe boldfaced terms are defined in the definitions section of the policy.\nAs North Pacific states in its complaint: \u201cThe accident occurred when Christopher Chase, a passenger sitting in the right front seat of the vehicle, momentarily grabbed and/or interfered with the steering wheel, causing defendant Christensen to lose control, cross the center line, and collide with another vehicle.\u201d CP at 8 (emphasis added).\nThis construction of the term \u201coperator\u201d corresponds with the definition found in the Motor Vehicle Code, Title 46 RCW: \u201c \u2018Operator or driver\u2019 means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\u201d RCW 46.04.370 (emphasis added). This meaning is also consistent with public policy: \u201cRCW 48.22.030 [the UIM statute] is to be liberally construed in order to provide broad protection against financially irresponsible motorists.\u201d Finney v. Farmers Ins. Co., 92 Wn.2d 748, 751, 600 P.2d 1272 (1979).\nCourts in other states have split as to whether a passenger who grabs the steering wheel is an \u201coperator.\u201d Some jurisdictions hold that a passenger who grabs the steering wheel is an operator. See Gibbs v. Nat\u2019l Gen. Ins. Co., 938 S.W.2d 600 (Mo. Ct. App. 1997); United States Fire Ins. Co. v. United Serv. Auto. Ass\u2019n, 772 S.W.2d 218 (Tex. Civ. App. 1989); United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Hokanson, 2 Kan. App. 2d 580, 584 P.2d 1264, 1267 (1978) (\u201c[W]hen a person takes control of a moving vehicle, even though for only an instant, that person has gained control over it and is operating it within the normal definition and understanding which ordinary laymen would give to an insurance policy.\u201d); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Larsen, 62 Ill. App. 3d 1, 377 N.E.2d 1218, 18 Ill. Dec. 582 (1978). Others hold that the passenger is interfering with the vehicle\u2019s operation. See Harrison v. Tomes, 956 S.W.2d 268 (Mo. 1997); Farm Bureau Gen. Ins. Co. v. Riddering, 172 Mich. App. 696, 432 N.W.2d 404 (1988); West Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Milwaukee Mut. Ins. Co., 384 N.W.2d 877 (Minn. 1986); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. White, 60 Or. App. 666, 655 P.2d 599 (1982).",

        "text": "Madsen, J.\n(concurring) \u2014 Although I agree with the majority\u2019s result, I disagree with its analysis. First, the majority concludes that the term \u201coperator\u201d in the North Pacific Insurance Company policy is not ambiguous. I disagree. Second, the majority states that using a criminal statutory definition of the term \u201coperator\u201d is superior to determining the meaning according to the average consumer of insurance. However, the principle is well settled that insurance terms should be construed in accord with the average insurance purchaser\u2019s understanding of the term. For these reasons, I concur only in result.\nAs noted, the majority concludes the term \u201coperator\u201d is unambiguous and means \u201ca person who is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\u201d Majority at 50. This is a dictionary definition of \u201cdriver,\u201d see Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 692 (1993), and is also the definition of \u201coperator\u201d found in the Motor Vehicle Code, specifically in RCW 46.04.370. See majority at 50 n.5.\nTurning first to the majority\u2019s reliance on the Motor Vehicle Code, there is no indication that the Legislature intended that the definition in the Motor Vehicle Code is to be applied to insurance policy provisions respecting underinsured motorist coverage. Because that definition accords with the dictionary definition of driver, however, the more important point to be made is that in discussing the statutory definition the majority completely departs from the essential rule for construing insurance policy language. The majority first pays lip service to this rule, i.e., that policy language is to be construed as \u201c \u2018an average insurance purchaser\u2019 \u201d would construe it. Majority at 48 (quoting Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Henault, 128 Wn.2d 207, 213, 905 P.2d 379 (1995)). Then, disregarding this well-settled principle of insurance contract construction, the majority calls the insurer\u2019s argument based upon this principle \u201cweak\u201d and says that \u201c[a] written definition by statute is clearly superior to supposition concerning the \u2018average insurance consumer\u2019s\u2019 understanding.\u201d Majority at 52-53. The majority is internally inconsistent and inappropriately dismisses the established rule of law. Its analysis injects needless uncertainty into other insurance policies having terms that must be construed because, while the statutory definition here may reflect the common understanding, that may not be true in other cases.\nAs to the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201coperator\u201d is unambiguous, I would instead apply the following reasoning. An insurance policy should be given a \u201cfair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given to the contract by the average person purchasing insurance.\u201d Kitsap County v. Allstate Ins. Co., 136 Wn.2d 567, 575, 964 P.2d 1173 (1998) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Undefined terms in a policy are to be given their \u201c \u2018plain, ordinary, and popular\u2019 \u201d meaning. Id. at 576 (quoting Boeing Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 113 Wn.2d 869, 877, 784 P.2d 507 (1990)).\nThe term \u201coperator\u201d is undefined. As the Court of Appeals observed, the ordinary definition of \u201c \u2018[o]perator\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018one that produces a physical effect or engages himself in the mechanical aspect of any process or activity as . . . [a] driver.\u2019 \u201d N. Pac. Ins. Co. v. Christensen, 95 Wn. App. 447, 451-52, 975 P.2d 552 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1581 (1969)), review granted, 139 Wn.2d 1001, 989 P.2d 1141 (1999). In relevant part, driver means, as noted, one in actual physical control of a vehicle. These definitions do not, in and of themselves, resolve the meaning of the term \u201coperator,\u201d because even under these definitions the term is subject to two reasonable interpretations in the context here:\nIn a narrow sense, the term may be limited to the primary driver and exclude a passenger who interferes with the driver\u2019s appropriate control and management of a vehicle by grabbing the steering wheel. But the term may also be interpreted more broadly to include any volitional act of control that [a]ffects the movement of a vehicle, such as when a passenger intentionally grabs the steering wheel without the driver\u2019s consent.\nHarrison v. Tomes, 956 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Mo. 1997). Both the narrow and broad interpretations fall within the standard dictionary definition. \u201cBecause there may be degrees of control over a vehicle\u2019s movement, ambiguity creeps into the term \u2018operated by\u2019.. . .\u201d W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Milwaukee Mut. Ins. Co., 384 N.W.2d 877, 879 (Minn. 1986). As the majority notes, courts have in fact split on the meaning of the term \u201coperator.\u201d Majority at 51 n.6.\nWhere ambiguity exists in an insurance policy, the court\u2019s goal is to interpret and enforce the contract as the parties intended. PUD No. 1 v. Int\u2019l Ins. Co., 124 Wn.2d 789, 799, 881 P.2d 1020 (1994). The contract is viewed as a whole, and its subject matter and objective are considered, as well as the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, subsequent conduct of the parties, and the reasonableness of their respective interpretations. Id. If ambiguity remains, then the ambiguity is resolved most favorably to the insured. Id.\nHere, the ambiguity remains unresolved. Where ambiguity remains in an inclusionary clause, liberal construction in favor of coverage is given where possible. Ross v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 132 Wn.2d 507, 515-17, 940 P.2d 252 (1997). Under this rule, \u201coperator\u201d includes the wheel-grabbing passenger. The circumstances involve a volitional act of control that affects the movement of the vehicle.\nThis conclusion is in harmony with the underinsured motorist statute. The underinsured motorist provisions do not provide any specific indication of the scope of coverage where underinsured operators are involved, and do not define \u201coperator.\u201d However, RCW 48.22.030 is to be liberally construed to provide broad protection from motorists who do not carry sufficient liability insurance. Touchette v. N.W. Mut. Ins. Co., 80 Wn.2d 327, 332, 494 P.2d 479 (1972).\nI would hold that the term \u201coperator\u201d as used in the policy language is ambiguous and should be construed in favor of coverage.\nThe majority\u2019s attempt to bolster its approval of the statutory definition in the Motor Vehicle Code is unconvincing. The majority suggests that \u201c[t]he fact that the definition is for purposes of a criminal statute actually enhances its value, for a person\u2019s liberty may depend upon it.\u201d Majority at 53. It is a little difficult to respond to this statement; however, I believe the court\u2019s goal in determining the meaning of an insurance term is not to engage in a metaphysical weighing of definitional values, but rather to ascertain what the term is intended to mean in the contract in light of the understanding of the average purchaser of insurance.\nI concur in the result.\nAlexander, C.J., Johnson, J., and Talmadge, J.
