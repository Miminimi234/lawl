        "text": "WILLIAM PRYOR, Circuit Judge:\nThis appeal requires us to decide whether a consumer reporting agency adopted an objectively unreasonable interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq., when it stated on a consumer\u2019s credit report that she was an authorized user of her parents\u2019 credit card account. Kathleen Pedro\u2019s parents listed her as an authorized user on their credit card account, which later went into default. A consumer reporting agency, TransUnion LLC, listed the delinquent account on Pedro\u2019s credit report with a notation that she was an authorized user of the account. TransUnion also included the account when calculating Pedro\u2019s credit score, which caused her credit score to fall. Pedro then filed, a complaint that TransUnion willfully violated a provision of the Act that requires that a consumer reporting agency \u201cfollow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681e(b), 1681n. The district court dismissed the complaint for failing to allege a plausible claim for relief. Because it was not objectively unreasonable for TransUn-ion to interpret section 1681e(b) to permit it to report an account for which a consumer is an authorized user, we affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nWhen Kathleen Pedro\u2019s parents fell ill, they designated her as an authorized user on their credit card account with Capital One. Pedro used the card to help her parents make purchases and to purchase airline tickets that she used to visit her parents. She alleged that, as an authorized user, \u201cshe never assumed and had no financial responsibility for any debts on that card.\u201d\nWhen Pedro\u2019s parents died in 2014, their account with Capital One went into default. On January 25, 2015, Pedro received an alert from a credit monitoring service that informed her that her credit score had dropped more than 100 points on her Equifax credit report. Pedro also discovered that her credit score had dropped on her TransUnion credit report, and she determined that the default on her parents\u2019 Capital One account caused the credit drop.\nAfter Pedro complained that the delinquency on her parents\u2019 account had affected her credit, Capital One removed Pedro from the account. But TransUnion did not remove the account from Pedro\u2019s credit report. TransUnion instead listed the account on her credit report with the notation \u201caccount relationship terminated.\u201d Capital One eventually requested that TransUnion and Equifax delete the account from Pedro\u2019s credit reports, and the agencies complied. Pedro alleged that her credit score then \u201creturned to its prior excellent level.\u201d\nPedro filed a complaint in the district court that Equifax and TransUnion had willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq., by failing to \u201cfollow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy\u201d of the credit reports of authorized users of credit card accounts, id. \u00a7\u00a7 1681e(b), 1681n. She alleged that the procedures used by Equifax and TransUnion that led them to report her parents\u2019 account on her credit report caused her credit reports to reflect a debt she did not owe, which in turn caused her credit report and score to be inaccurate. The gravamen of Pedro\u2019s complaint was that it was inaccurate to list her parents\u2019 credit card account on her credit report because it implied that she was liable on the account when she was not. She sought statutory damages, punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and the certification of a class action.\nEquifax moved to dismiss Pedro\u2019s complaint, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and Tran-sUnion joined the motion. The agencies argued that Pedro could not -establish a willful violation of the Act because the agencies followed an objectively reasonable interpretation of the Act. See Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 69, 127 S.Ct. 2201, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2007). The district court granted the motion to dismiss. It determined that Pedro failed to allege a willful violation of section 1681e(b) because it was not objectively unreasonable for the consumer reporting agencies to read section 1681e(b) to permit them to report information about accounts for which the consumer is an authorized user. Pedro appealed, and at her request, we dismissed her appeal as to Equifax.\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u201cWe review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and construe all the allegations as true.\u201d Feldman v. Am. Dawn, Inc., 849 F.3d 1333, 1339 (11th Cir. 2017). \u201cA plaintiff must plausibly allege all the elements of the claim for relief. Conclusory allegations and legal conclusions are not sufficient; the plaintiff[ ] must state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Id. at 1339-40 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nWe divide our discussion in two parts. First, we explain that Pedro has standing because she alleged that she suffered an injury in fact. Second, we explain that the district court correctly dismissed Pedro\u2019s complaint because TransUnion could not have willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nA. Pedro Alleged That She Suffered an Injury in Fact.\nArticle III of the Constitution of the United States \u201crestricts the jurisdiction of the federal courts to litigants who have standing to sue.\u201d Nicklaw v. Citi-Mortgage, Inc., 839 F.3d 998, 1001 (11th Cir. 2016). This threshold requirement \u201cmust be addressed prior to and independent of the merits of a party\u2019s claims.\u201d Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1349 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Pedro, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, \u201cbears the burden of proving standing.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing\u201d consists of three elements: injury in fact, causation, and re-dressability. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). TransUnion contends that Pedro lacks standing because she failed to prove that she suffered an injury in fact. We disagree.\n\u201cAn injury sufficient for standing purposes is \u2018an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u2019\u201d Common Cause/Ga., 554 F.3d at 1350 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at 2136). A concrete injury \u201cmust actually exist,\u201d meaning it must be \u201creal and not abstract.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1548, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). An intangible injury, like a violation of the right to free speech, can be concrete. Id. at 1549.\n\u201cIn determining whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress play important roles.\u201d Id. \u201c[I]t is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\u201d Id. And Congress may \u201celevate to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law.\u201d Id. (alteration adopted) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 578, 112 S.Ct. at 2145). An injury is \u201cparticularized\u201d if it \u201caffect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\u201d Id. at 1548 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1, 112 S.Ct. at 2136).\nPedro alleged an injury that is both concrete and particular. Pedro alleged a concrete injury because the harm caused by the alleged violation of the Act \u2014 the reporting of inaccurate information about Pedro\u2019s credit to a credit monitoring service \u2014 -has a close relationship to the harm caused by the, publication of defamatory information, which has long provided the basis for a lawsuit in English and American courts. See, e.g,, Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 569 cmt. g (Am. Law Inst. 1938) (explaining that it is \u201cactionable per se\u201d to publish a false statement that another has \u201crefus[ed] to pay his debts\u201d). Pedro also alleged a concrete injury because she alleged that she \u201clost time ... attempting to resolve the credit inaccuracies.\u201d Cf. Palm Beach Golf Center-Boca, Inc. v. John G. Sarris, D.D.S., P.A., 781 F.3d 1245, 1252-53 (11th Cir. 2015) (explaining that the occupation of a fax machine during the transmission of an unwanted fax constituted a concrete injury). And Pedro\u2019s alleged injuries affected her personally. Indeed, her credit score dropped 100 points as a result of the challenged conduct. Because Pedro alleged that she suffered an injury in fact, she has standing to pursue her complaint.\nB. Pedro's Complaint Failed to State a Claim.\nCongress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act to ensure \u201cfair and accurate credit reporting.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a)(1). In pursuit of this goal, the Act \u201cimposes a host of requirements concerning the creation and use of consumer reports,\u201d Spok-eo, 136 S.Ct at 1545, and makes any consumer reporting agency that willfully fails to comply with one of these requirements with respect to a consumer liable to that consumer for actual, statutory, or punitive damages, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a). Pedro argues that' TransUnion willfully violated section 1681e(b) of the Act, which states that \u201c[w]henever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1681e(b) (emphasis added). We disagree.\nTo establish that TransUnion willfully failed to comply with, section 1681e(b), Pedro must establish that Tran-sUnion either knowingly or. recklessly violated that section. Levine v. World Fin. Network Nat\u2019l Bank, 554 F.3d 1314, 1318 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Safeco, 551 U.S. at 56-57, 127 S.Ct. at 2208. An ageney recklessly violates the Act if it takes an action that \u201cis not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute\u2019s terms, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law-substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.\u201d Safeco, 551 U.S. at 69, 127 S.Ct. at 2215. A consumer reporting agency that adopts a reading of the Act that is \u201cnot objectively unreasonable\u201d based on the text of the Act, judicial precedent, or guidance from administrative agencies \u201cfalls well short of raising the \u2018unjustifiably high risk\u2019 of violating the statute necessary for. reckless liability.\u201d Id. at 70, 127 S.Ct. at 2216. A consumer reporting agency that adopts an objectively reasonable reading of the Act does not knowingly violate the Act. Id. at 70 n.20, 127 S.Ct. at 2216 n.20. So contrary to Pedro\u2019s argument, if TransUnion adopted an interpretation .of the Act that was not objectively unreasonable, we will not look at its subjective intent. See Levine, 554 F.3d at 1319 (declining to consider the subjective intent of a consumer reporting agency when it \u201cact[ed] in accord with an objectively reasonable interpretation of the Act\u201d).\nTransUnion adopted an interpretation of the Act that was objectively reasonable. TransUnion.,could have reasonably inter-; preted the,Act to permit it to .report that Pedro was an authorized user on her parents\u2019 credit card,, account because it could have understood the standard of \u201cmaximum possible accuracy,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b), to require only that TransUn-, ion report information that is technically accurate, That interpretation is not objectively unreasonable because it has a \u201cfoundation in the statutory text and a sufficiently convincing justification.\u201d Safeco, 551 U.S. at 69-70, 127 S.Ct. at 2216.\nCourts have offered two definitions of \u201cmaximum possible accuracy,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b). Some courts have ruled that the standard requires only that credit reporting agencies report information that is \u201ctechnically accurate;\u201d that is, information that is not false. Heupel v. Trans Union LLC, 193 F.Supp.2d 1234, 1240 (N.D. Ala. 2002); see Grant v. TRW, Inc., 789 F.Supp. 690, 692 (D. Md. 1992); accord McPhee v. Chilton Corp., 468 F.Supp. 494, 497-98 (D. Conn. 1978). Under this approach, Tran-sUnion complied with the Act when it reported that Pedro was an authorized user on her parents\u2019 account because that information was true. Other courts have ruled that section' 1681e(b) requires that credit reporting agencies report information that is both \u201ctechnically accurate\u201d and not misleading or incomplete. See Dalton v. Capital Associated Indus., Inc., 257 F.3d 409, 415 (4th Cir. 2001); Pinner v. Schmidt, 805 F.2d 1258, 1261, 1263 (5th Cir. 1986); Koropoulos v. Credit Bureau, Inc., 734 F.2d 37, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Under this approach, TransUnion complied with the Act when it reported that Pedro was an authorized user on her parents\u2019 account only if that information was not misleading or incomplete.\nAlthough the better reading of the Act requires that credit reports be both accurate and not misleading, we cannot say that reading the Act to require only technical accuracy was objectively unreasonable. The definitions of \u201cmaximum,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d and \u201caccuracy\u201d suggest that the information reported by a consumer reporting agency must be free from error to the greatest extent within the power of the consumer reporting agency. See Maximum, Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1517 (2d ed. 1961) (defining \u201cmaximum\u201d as \u201c[greatest in quantity or highest in degree attainable or attained\u201d); id. at 1927 (defining \u201cpossible\u201d as \u201c[w]ith-in the powers of performance attainment\u201d); id. at 17 (defining \u201caccuracy\u201d as \u201cfreedom .from -mistake or error\u201d). That is, in addition to being true, the information must not be misleading. But the less stringent approach of technical accuracy also has a foundation in the text. Several courts have read the Act to require only technical accuracy. Heupel, 193 F.Supp.2d at 1240; Grant, 789 F.Supp, at 692; McPhee, 468 F.Supp. at 497-98. Although other courts disagree with that reading, e.g., Dalton, 257 F.3d at 415, where the courts are divided, it was not objectively unreasonable, for TransUnion to read the Act to require only technical accuracy, cf. Murray v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., 523 F.3d 719, 726 (7th Cir. 2008) (Easterbrook, J.) (determining that the interpretation of a reporting agency that \u201cconspicuous\u201d included six-point type was objectively reasonable where courts of appeals disagreed on the interpretation of \u201cconspicuous\u201d). Because the reading adopted by TransUnion \u201chas a foundation in the statutory text and a sufficiently convincing justification to have persuaded, [multiple courts] to adopt it,\u201d Safeco, 551 U.S. at 69-70, 127 S.Ct. at 2205, that reading was not objectively unreasonable even though we disagree with it:\n\u25a0 Pedro also fails to cite any authority that \u201cmight have warned [TransUnion] away from the view it took.\u201d Id. at 70, 127 S.Ct. at 2216. Pedro cites no judicial precedent or agency guidance that states that reporting information about accounts for which a consumer is an authorized user fails to meet the standard of maximum possible accuracy. To the contrary, at least one district court has held that it is not inaccurate to list authorized user information on a credit report. See Bailey v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, No. 13-10377, 2013 WL 3305710, at *6 (E.D. Mich. July 1, 2013).\nBecause TransUnion adopted an interpretation of the Act that was not objectively unreasonable, it did not willfully violate the requirement that it follow reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of reported information. TransUnion could reasonably interpret the Act to permit it to report information that was technically accurate: that Pedro was an authorized user of her parents\u2019 credit card account. TransUnion could not have willfully violated the requirement that it adopt reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy if, under a reasonable interpretation of the Act, the information it reported met the standard of maximum possible accuracy.\nPedro contends that TransUnion willfully violated section 1681e(b) even under the approach of technical accuracy, but she fails to identify any false information' reported by TransUnion. She maintains that reporting the credit delinquencies of her parents on her credit report cannot be \u201ctechnically accurate\u201d because it caused her credit report to list the credit history of someone other than her. But TransUn-ion listed that information on Pedro\u2019s credit report with the notation \u201cauthorized user,\u201d and Pedro admits that she was an authorized user of her parents\u2019 account. Because the information TransUnion reported was true, it met the standard of technical accuracy.\nPedro also asserts that TransUnion willfully violated section 1681e(b) when it reported information about her parents\u2019 credit card account on her credit report because the information did not \u201cconcern[ ] the individual about whom the report relates,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b), but it was not objectively unreasonable for TransUnion to determine that information about a credit card account for which an individual is an authorized user concerns that individual. Although Pedro asserts that she was not financially hable for debts on her parents\u2019 credit card account, her name was on the account and she used the credit card to make purchases. It was reasonable for TransUnion to determine that information about the account concerned Pedro.\nFinally, Pedro argues that \u201c[wjillfulness is a question of fact almost never suitable to resolution on a motion to dismiss,\u201d but we disagree. District courts may, and often do, determine on the pleadings that a plaintiff failed to plead willfulness when the interpretation of the relevant statute by the consumer reporting agency was not objectively unreasonable. See King v. MovieTickets.com, Inc., 555 F.Supp.2d 1339, 1342-43 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Horsch v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., 94 F.Supp.3d 665, 678 (E.D. Pa. 2015); see also Shlahtichman v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 615 F.3d 794, 795-96, 803-04 (7th Cir. 2010) (affirming the dismissal of a complaint where it was objectively reasonable for an agency to interpret a provision in the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act not to apply to email receipts); Long v. Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc., 671 F.3d 371, 377 (3d Cir. 2012) (same). And although Pedro states that Hinkle v. Midland Credit Management, Inc. establishes that willfulness is almost never resolvable on a motion to dismiss, the consumer reporting agency in Hinkle did not argue that it had adopted an objectively reasonable interpretation of the Act. 827 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2016). As a result, we did not address whether the interpretation of the agency was objectively reasonable.\nThe district court correctly dismissed Pedro\u2019s complaint. TransUnion interpreted section 1681e(b) to permit it to report information that was technically accurate, such as Pedro\u2019s status as an authorized user on her parents\u2019 credit card account. That interpretation was not objectively unreasonable based on the text of the Act, judicial precedent, and guidance from administrative agencies. Because TransUnio'n adopted an interpretation of the Act that was objectively reasonable, TransUnion did not willfully violate the Act.\nIY. CONCLUSION\nWe AFFIRM the dismissal of Pedro\u2019s complaint.",

        "text": "ROSENBAUM, Circuit Judge,\nconcurring:\nI agree with the panel opinion. I write separately, though, to address in more depth some of the issues this appeal raises.\nI.\nA.\nWe have previously described the twin goals of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681, et seq., as \u201censuring that [credit-reporting] agencies imposed procedures that were ... \u2018fair and equitable to the consumer,\u2019 ... [and] that also met the \u2018needs of commerce\u2019 for accurate credit reporting.\u201d Cahlin v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 936 F.2d 1151, 1158 (11th Cir, 1991) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(b)). Towards those ends, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b) requires that \u201c[w]henever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.\u201d\nHere, the dispute concerns the meaning of \u201cmaximum possible accuracy\u201d within \u00a7 1681e(b). All four Circuits that have opined on this phrase have agreed that it means something more than \u201ctechnical accuracy.\u201d See Cortez v. Trans Union, LLC, 617 F.3d 688, 709 (3d Cir. 2010) (describing the \u201cdistinction between \u2018accuracy\u2019 and \u2018maximum possible accuracy\u201d\u2019 as \u201cquite dramatic\u201d); Dalton v. Capital Associated Indus., Inc., 257 F.3d 409, 415 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201cA report is inaccurate when it is \u2018patently incorrect\u2019 or when it is \u2018misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to [have an] adverse []\u2019 effect\u201d) (citation omitted); Koropoulos v. Credit Bureau, Inc., 734 F.2d 37, 40 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\u201cWe think it clear that Congress meant the Act to address more than technically inaccurate reports.\u201d); Pinner v. Schmidt, 805 F.2d 1258, 1262-63 (5th Cir. 1986); cf. Gorman v. Wolpoff & Abramson, LLP, 584 F.3d 1147, 1163 (9th Cir. 2009) (discussing the difference between \u201ctechnical ] [in]accura[cy]\u201d and \u201cinaccurate\u201d while opining on the meaning of the phrase \u201cif the investigation finds that the information is incomplete or inaccurate,\u201d found within 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b)(l)(D)).\nRather, based on the language of the phrase and the purpose of the FCRA, these courts have determined that \u201cmaximum possible accuracy\u201d means that a report must not be misleading or incomplete. See Cortez, 617 F.3d at 709; Dalton, 257 F.3d at 415; Koropoulos, 734 F.2d at 40-44; Pinner, 805 F.2d at 1262-63. As the Fourth Circuit has explained, \u201cA report is inaccurate ... when it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to have an adverse effect.\u201d Dalton, 257 F.3d at 415 (alteration, quotation marks, and citation omitted).\nJudge Fong succinctly and effectively explained the practical and important difference between a report that is \u201ctechnically accurate\u201d and one that has \u201cmaximum possible accuracy\u201d: it\u2019s the difference between \u201creport[ing] that a person was \u2018involved\u2019 in a credit card scam\u201d and \u201creporting] that he -was in fact one of the victims of the scam.\u201d Alexander v. Moore & Assocs., Inc., 553 F.Supp. 948, 952 (D. Haw. 1982); see also Pinner, 805 F.2d at 1263 (quoting Judge Fong\u2019s explanation, as quoted in Swoager v. Credit Bureau of Greater St. Petersburg, 608 F.Supp. 972, 977 (M.D. Fla. 1985)); Cortez, 617 F.3d at 709 (quoting Pinner's reliance on Judge Fong\u2019s explanation).\nBut though \u00a7 1681e(b) speaks of \u201cmaximum possible accuracy,\u201d it also qualifies the limits of the required \u201cmaximum possible accuracy.\u201d A credit-reporting agency need only follow \u201creasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy.\u201d 15 U.S;C. \u00a7 1681e(b).-\nThe District of Columbia Circuit has construed this language to impose a balancing test. Koropoulos, 734 F.2d at 42. Under this balancing test, the court \u201cweights] the potential that the information will create a misleading impression against the availability of more accurate [or complete] information and the burden of providing such information.\u201d Id. (quoting Alexander, 553 F.Supp. at 952) (quotation marks omitted). The greater the potential to mislead (meaning, \u201cthe greater the harm [the information] can cause the consumer\u201d) and th\u00e9 more readily available \u201cclarifying information,\u201d the higher the reporting agency\u2019s burden to provide the clarifying information. Id. (quoting Alexander, 553 F.Supp. at 952) (quotation marks omitted). But on the other side of the coin, a reporting agency need not undertake a b\u00fardensome task to provide clarifying information when \u201cthe misleading information is of relatively insignificant value\u201d and the agency\u2019s procedures are otherwise reasonable. Id. (quoting Alexander, 553 F.Supp. at 952) (quotation marks omitted); see also Cortez, 617 F.3d at 709 (\u201cJudging the reasonableness of a credit reporting agency\u2019s procedures involves weighing the potential harm from inaccuracy against the burden of safeguarding against such inaccuracy.\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\nB.\nWith these standards in mind, X consider whether TransUnion\u2019s reporting of Pedro\u2019s parents\u2019 delinquent account information on Pedro\u2019s credit report satisfied the \u201cmaximum possible accuracy\u201d standard. First, we must assess whether the inclusion \u00f3f the information was misleading in a harmful way. Clearly, it was.\nTrue, TransUnion reported that Pedro was only an authorized user on her parents\u2019 account. TransUnion also asserted during oral argument that those who use the reports would understand from the code TransUnion used to report her authorized-user status that Pedro was not financially responsible for her parents\u2019 delinquent account. But significantly, the report appears to give no indication that including this account information caused Pedro\u2019s credit score to drop more\u2019than 100 points. That 100-point-plus drop \u2014 due to no fault of Pedro\u2019s \u2014 harmed Pedro in that it \u201creduc[ed] ... her ability to obtain credit, ... increased] ... the cost of obtaining such credit that she was able to secure, los[t] [her] economic opportunities, and los[t] [her] creditworthiness.\u201d Compl., \u00b6 30. Yet the information did not accurately reflect on her personal creditworthiness. Indeed, almost as soon as the information was removed, Pedro\u2019s credit rating returned to its \u201cprior excellent level.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29.\nWe have said that FCRA\u2019s goals include fairness and equity to the consumer while still meeting the needs of commerce for accurate information in credit reports. Reporting delinquent \u201cauthorized user\u201d accounts where the user is not financially responsible for the debt, without indicating how including such information in the credit score affects the credit score meets neither goal. Rather, stating the consumer\u2019s credit score both with and without accounts for which she is not financially \u2022responsible gives the consumer and those who rely on credit reports the fairest, most accurate, and least misleading picture of the consumer\u2019s credit. And for this reason, it much better satisfies the purposes of FCRA than the reporting practice at issue here.\nBut that is not the end of the analysis. We must also consider the burden on TransUnion to provide such information in its credit reports. TransUnion uniquely possesses the information necessary to evaluate the burden such a procedure would place on it. For that reason, this part of the inquiry of whether Pedro' stated a claim that TransUnion violated \u00a7 1681e(b) often will be inappropriate for resolution at the motion-to-dismiss stage.\nII.\nHere, though, we need not remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings because Pedro alleges only a willful violation. And for the reasons my colleague has explained, she cannot show that.",
