        "text": "LYNCH, Chief Judge.\nThis is a dispute between a group of now-retired union employees over certain \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits which their union Pension Trust wants to eliminate, and the Trust, which is in distress and trying to find sources of funding to meet its obligations to its larger group of plan participants. The Trustees agreed not to impose the cuts until a court had finally determined whether these cuts, effectuated through Plan Amendment Nine, violated the anti-cutback provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., which protects \u201caccrued benefits\u201d against reduction by amendment. Id. \u00a7 1054(g)(1).\nThis case raises a question of first impression in this circuit as to whether a retroactively conferred benefit during the course of employment constitutes a \u201cbenefit attributable to service\u201d and so an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d for purposes of ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs. While the Trustees\u2019 arguments to the contrary are far from frivolous, we find the plaintiffs\u2019 benefits are in fact \u201caccrued\u201d and that Amendment Nine would violate the anti-cutback provisions. We affirm the district court on this basis.\nI.\nThe Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union # 51 (\u201cthe Union\u201d) is a labor organization situated in East Providence, Rhode Island. The Union represents pipefitters and plumbers in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts. The Union came to be on September 1, 1997 through the merger of four former local unions. After the merger, the local unions\u2019 employee benefits plans and related plans and funds also merged. The result was the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union # 51 Pension Plan (\u201cPost-Merger Plan\u201d), dated September 1, 1998. This is the plan which concerns us. The pre-merger plans no longer exist.\nAmong the pension benefits promised under both the Pre-and Post-Merger Plans were \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits. \u201cBanked hours\u201d are hours of service worked in covered employment or otherwise accrued by plan participants within a given year in excess of the minimum number of hours required to earn a full year of service for pension credit under the applicable plan. Such hours are \u201cbanked\u201d for a variety of uses, including filling in of hours of service for years in which the participant fell short of the minimum required for a full year of credit and \u201ccashing] in\u201d as additional pension credits upon retirement.\nOne problem the Post-Merger Plan had to deal with was that the \u201cbanked hour\u201d provisions were different in each of the four pre-merger plans. Indeed, the provisions contained in the various pre-merger plan documents had different accrual, use, and value of \u201cbanked hours.\u201d For example, under the pre-merger plans, the minimum number of hours of service needed for the receipt of a full year of pension credit ranged from 1,200 in one plan to 1,710 hours in another. The Post-Merger Plan Document eliminated those variations and chose to use as to each \u201cbanked hour\u201d provision among the most generous benefit terms from the earlier provisions. For example, under the Post-Merger Plan, the minimum number of hours of service required for the receipt of a full year of pension credit was only 1,200 hours for all participants. The Post-Merger Plan Document\u2019s more generous \u201cbanked hour\u201d provisions had both prospective and retrospective effect. As a result, a number of plan participants, the plaintiffs among them, received retrospectively increased levels of \u201cbanked hour\u201d pension credits and increased pension benefit levels immediately after the merger pursuant to those more generous provisions. This case involves only those retrospective benefits.\nOver the past several years, the Trust has experienced funding deficiencies caused by a number of factors, including stock market fluctuations and decreased pension contributions resulting from unemployment and lack of work opportunities for plan participants. The Trustees explored and adopted various measures intended to improve the Plan\u2019s financial health.\nIn August 2011, after discussions with the Plan\u2019s actuarial consultant, the Trustees voted upon and enacted Amendment Nine to the Post-Merger Plan Document. Amendment Nine purports to reduce plan participants\u2019 retrospective \u201cbanked hour\u201d pension benefits for hours accumulated prior to September 1, 1998, the date of the Post-Merger Plan, back to the lower levels promised under plan participants\u2019 respective pre-merger plan document. The Trustees say Amendment Nine would reduce the Plan\u2019s liability by several million dollars. On or about October 6, 2011, the Trustees sent a notice to all participants in the Pos1>-Merger Plan alerting them to the retroactive benefit reductions that would result from Amendment Nine.\nOn November 3, 2011, the plaintiffs filed this action against the Trustees in the district of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs alleged that the implementation of Amendment Nine would conflict with ERISA\u2019s so-called \u201canti-cutback\u201d rule, which prohibits the \u201cdecrease[] by amendment\u201d of any \u201caccrued benefit of a participant\u201d in an ERISA plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(1). The plaintiffs maintained that all of their pre-September 1, 1998 \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits, whether prospective from September 1 or retrospective, had \u201caccrued.\u201d They relied on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23), which defines the term \u201caccrued benefit\u201d for purposes of ERISA. The Trustees agreed to suspend the implementation of Amendment Nine pending the result of this action.\nOn April 5, 2013, the district court orally-granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the Trustees\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits did constitute \u201caccrued benefits\u201d under ERISA. The district court noted that, at the time of the merger and the bestowing of uniform \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits in the Plan, the plaintiffs were active employees as opposed to retirees. The Plan was also unchanged at their retirement date. Indeed, they had received the very benefits after retirement that the Trustees now seek to cut. As such, the district court reasoned, \u201c[w]hen the Plaintiffs retired, their expectations of receiving the banked-hours benefits in the [Post-Merger] Plan were justified.\u201d On this basis, the district court concluded that the implementation of Amendment Nine would result in the \u201cdecrease[ ] by amendment\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201caccrued benefits\u201d in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(1).\nOn appeal, the Trustees argue that the district court erred in holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 \u201cbanked hour\u201d retrospective benefits are \u201caccrued benefits\u201d under ERISA.\nII.\nThis court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Pag\u00e1n-S\u00e1nchez, 539 F.3d 19, 21 (1st Cir.2008). \u201cOn an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment, the standard does not change; we view each motion separately and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the respective non-moving party.\u201d Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield v. City of Springfield, 724 F.3d 78, 89 (1st Cir.2013). The parties agree upon all material facts. This court is left to address pure questions of law.\nERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule prohibits the \u201cdecrease[] by amendment\u201d of any \u201caccrued benefit of a participant\u201d in an ERISA plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(1); accord 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(d)(6)(A); see also Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Heinz, 541 U.S. 739, 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230, 159 L.Ed.2d 46 (2004) (describing ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule as \u201ccrucial to th[e] object\u201d of protecting employees\u2019 justified expectations). A plan must not violate the rule in order to remain qualified for tax-exempt status. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(d)(6)(A). The purpose of this was set forth in Central Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund, where the Supreme Court said:\n[W]hen Congress enacted ERISA, it wanted to ... mak[e] sure that if a worker has been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement \u2014 and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit \u2014 he actually will receive it.\n541 U.S. at 743, 124 S.Ct. 2230 (alterations in original) (quoting Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U.S. 882, 887, 116 S.Ct. 1783, 135 L.Ed.2d 153 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Trustees\u2019 core argument is that the plaintiffs did not \u201cearn\u201d these retrospective benefits by working; the retrospective benefits were a gratuity resulting from a prior merger of benefit plans. The term \u201cearned\u201d appears nowhere in the statute, although it does in some ease law as a shorthand term, and we do not adopt it as a substitute term for the statutory language. The Trustees argue, based on the concept of \u201cearned\u201d benefits, that the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits were conferred retroactively, and that retroactively conferred benefits are unearned gratuities and as a result cannot \u201caccrue[ ].\u201d We disagree. The Trustees\u2019 position is not irrational as a matter of policy, but Congress chose otherwise. The Trustees\u2019 position has no basis in the statutory text.\nThe Trustees\u2019 position is that in order for a benefit to \u201caccrue[]\u201d under section 1054(g)(1), the promise of the relevant benefit must necessarily predate the service to which that benefit corresponds. The Trustees argue that an employee can only \u201cearn\u201d a benefit through service if she has been promised that benefit in advance. This is based on the reasoning that any benefit not promised beforehand is by definition unexpected, and that any unexpected benefit constitutes a mere gratuity. In other words, according to the Trustees, a benefit can only be \u201cearned\u201d through service if the promise of a benefit could have provided incentives to perform that service. ERISA does require that the promise of a benefit provide incentives to continue employment in order for that benefit to \u201caccrue[ ].\u201d But that condition is satisfied here.\nSection 1054(g) explains that the anti-cutback rule applies only to \u201cbenefits attributable to service\u201d prior to the amendment at issue. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g). And in this sense, \u201caccrued benefits\u201d are contrasted with mere \u201cgratuities].\u201d Bd. of Trs. of Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund v. Comm\u2019r, 318 F.3d 599, 604 (4th Cir.2003). In addition, contrasted with other statutory language the restriction on \u201cbenefits attributable to service\u201d means that \u201caccrued benefits\u201d must be attributable to service already performed. See Cinotto v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 674 F.3d 1285, 1294 (11th Cir.2012) (observing the distinction between \u201caccrued benefits\u201d and \u201canticipated benefits based on future years of service\u201d). Here, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits are clearly \u201cattributable to\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 service. That those benefits were conferred retroactively does not defeat that point.\nOther than through section 1054(g), the text of ERISA provides few clues as to the interpretation of \u201caccrued benefit.\u201d Section 1002 of Title 29 defines \u201caccrued benefit\u201d as follows:\n(23) The term \u201caccrued benefit\u201d means\u2014\n(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the individual\u2019s accrued benefit determined under the plan and, except as provided in section 1054(c)(3) of this title, expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or\n(B) in the case of a plan which is an individual account plan, the balance of the individual\u2019s account.\nThe accrued benefit of an employee shall not be less than the amount determined under section 1054(c)(2)(B) of this title with respect to the employee\u2019s accumulated contribution.\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23); accord 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(7)(A). Because the PosU-Merger Plan is a defined benefit plan, most relevant here is section 1002(23)(A). Under that provision, an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d is \u201cthe individual\u2019s accrued benefit determined under the plan and ... expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23)(A). As the Supreme Court has observed, section 1002(23)(A)\u2019s \u201crather circular[]\u201d definition provides little guidance. Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund, 541 U.S. at 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230. Indeed, \u201c[t]he only apparent textual limit\u201d is that an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d must be \u201cexpressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\u201d Bd. of Trustees of Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund, 318 F.3d at 603 (discussing the parallel provision in the Internal Revenue Code). The parties agree that limit is satisfied in this case. Apart from that limit, section 1002(23)(A) appears to be nothing more than a \u201csignpost directing us to look to the terms of the plan at issue.\u201d Id. at 602-03.\nSection 1002(23) does explain that \u201c[t]he accrued benefit of an employee shall not be less than the amount determined under section 1054(c)(2)(B) of this title with respect to the employee\u2019s accumulated contribution.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23); accord 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(7)(D). For present purposes, the substance of this requirement is of no matter. What is relevant is the provision\u2019s use of the term \u201cemployee\u201d as well as its tethering of \u201caccrued benefits\u201d to the \u201cemployee\u2019s accumulated contribution.\u201d There is no doubt that the plaintiffs were employees at the time they were promised the benefits. This benefit scheme also applied at the time they retired.\nSection 1002(6) of Title 29 defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany individual employed by an employer.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(6). Under ERISA, an \u201cemployee\u201d thus contrasts with a \u201cparticipant.\u201d \u201cParticipant\u201d is in turn defined by section 1002(7) as:\nany employee or former employee of an employer, or any member or former member of an employee organization, who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization, or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.\nId. \u00a7 1002(7).\n. That there is a relevant distinction between \u201cemployees\u201d and mere \u201cparticipants\u201d as to accrual is reinforced by the contrasting language of section 1054(g)(1). Under that provision, \u201c[t]he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(1) (emphasis added); accord 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(d)(6). Section 1054(g)(1) refers to \u201cparticipant[s]\u201d rather than \u201cemployee[s]\u201d for good reason: If ERISA\u2019s purpose is to \u201cmak[e] sure\u201d that a worker \u201cactually ... receive[s]\u201d the defined pension benefit promised to her \u201cupon retirement,\u201d Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 375, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980), it would be nonsensical for anti-cutback protection to cease the moment employment ends and retirement begins.\nTaken together, sections 1002(23) and 1054(g)(1) outline the following scheme: \u201c[A] retirement benefit may be \u2018accrued\u2019 only by an \u2018employee\u2019, but, once accrued, the benefit is protected from diminution as long as the individual who accrued the benefit is a \u2018participant\u2019 in the plan, whether as an employee or as a retiree.\u201d Thornton, 566 F.3d at 607 (discussing parallel Internal Revenue Code provisions) (quoting Bd. of Trs. of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund v. Comm\u2019r, 117 T.C. 220, 228-29 (2001)). Under this scheme, a promised benefit must provide incentives for future employment in order for that benefit to \u201caccrue! ],\u201d just in the sense that the promise of a benefit must predate an individual\u2019s retirement or termination. See, e.g., Williams v. Rohm & Haas Pension Plan, 497 F.3d 710, 714 (7th Cir.2007) (holding that cost of living adjustment (\u201cCOLA\u201d) was an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d where promise of COLA predated plaintiffs\u2019retirement); Bd. of Trs. of Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund v. Comm\u2019r, 318 F.3d 599, 604 (4th Cir.2003) (holding that COLA was a \u201cgratuitous benefit\u201d where promise of COLA postdated plaintiffs\u2019 retirement). Once an individual continues employment in exchange for a promised benefit, that is enough, other things being the same, to generate the sort of \u201cjustified expectation!]\u201d the anti-cutback rule is designed to protect. Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund, 541 U.S. at 743, 124 S.Ct. 2230.\nWe sum up. The Trustees properly concede that under the terms of the Post-Merger Plan prior to Amendment Nine, the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 service entitles them to at least their preSeptember 1998 prospective \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits. The Trustees concede further that the plaintiffs were \u201cemployeefs]\u201d under the Post-Merger Plan when that plan went into effect. Finally, the Trustees concede that the plaintiffs are still plan \u201cparticipant^].\u201d We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-September 1, 1998 \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits, prospective and retrospective, are \u201caccrued benefits\u201d for purposes of section 1054(g)(1) and, so, that Amendment Nine is inconsistent with the requirements of ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rule. The Trastees\u2019 real argument is that the plaintiffs did not \u201cearn\u201d their preSeptember 1998 retrospective \u201cbanked hour\u201d benefits \u2014 that they were a \u201cgift\u201d of sorts. But ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback rale does not ask whether benefits were \u201cearned.\u201d Rather, it asks whether benefits have \u201caccrued.\u201d We decline the Trustees\u2019 invitation to amend the statute.\nThe district court is affirmed.\n. This benefit provision was subsequently amended and prospectively reduced. That amendment is not at issue here.\n. In 2010 and again in 2012 the Post-Merger Plan was declared to be in critical status , under the Pension Protection Act. of 2006 (\"PPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 109-280, 120 Stat. 780. The Trustees do not argue that either the fact that the Plan was in critical status under PPA or the fact that they were required as a result to formulate a Rehabilitation Plan in any way alters the law on the anti-cutback rule.\nThe anti-cutback rule does permit the decrease by amendment of accrued benefits in cases where a plan faces a \"substantial business hardship,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1082(d)(2), and in cases involving terminated multi-employer plans, id. \u00a7 1441. Neither exception applies here.\n. Should the Post-Merger Plan ultimately become insolvent, the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which insures multi-employer pension plans such as this one, will be required to intervene. See Sun Capital Partners III, LP v. New Eng. Teamsters & Trucking Indus. Pension Fund, 724 F.3d 129, 132 n. 2 (1st Cir.2013).\n. We have no reason to reach an argument made by the plaintiffs that the initial provision of benefits to them upon retirement somehow estops the Trustees from denying the benefits were \"accrued.\u201d\n. The parties agree that Amendment Nine would result in the \"decrease!]\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 retrospective pre-September 1, 1998 \"banked hour\u201d benefits under their ERISA plan.\n. See, e.g., Thornton v. Graphic Commons Conference of Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters Supplemental Ret. & Disability Fund, 566 F.3d 597, 602 (6th Cir.2009); Silvernail v. Ameritech Pension Plan, 439 F.3d 355, 359 (7th Cir.2006).\n. The plan document at issue contains no language to suggest that the plaintiffs' pre-September 1998 \"banked hour\" benefits were not intended to be eligible for \"accru[al].\u201d\n. Although the plaintiffs are all now retired, the parties agree that each plaintiff worked in the service for a covered employer for some period of time following the merger.\n. We are not faced with a situation in which a post-retirement increase in benefits was specified in pension plan documents while the employee worked in the service of the employer. See Thornton, 566 F.3d at 607.\n. The Trustees contend that their interpretation of the anti-cutback rule finds support in the decisions of other circuits. The decisions on which the Trustees rely, however, concern only benefits promised after retirement. See Rohm & Haas Pension Plan, 497 F.3d at 714 (holding that benefit cannot \"accrue!]\u201d if it is \"not included in the plan during the term of the participants\u2019 employment \u201d (emphasis added)); Thornton, 566 F.3d at 609 (holding that an amendment cannot give rise to an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d for an individual if \u201cthe amendment occurred after he or she permanently separated from covered employment \u201d (emphasis added)); Bd. of Trs. of Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund, 318 F.3d at 604 (\"[T]he benefit could not have been an 'accrued benefit\u2019 because it did not accumulate during their service so as to become part of their legitimate expectations at retirement under the terms of the Plan then in effect.\u201d (emphasis added)).",
