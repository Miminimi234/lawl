        "text": "PER CURIAM.\nEduardo Penaloza-Romero was a leader of a drug trafficking organization that transported methamphetamine from California and distributed it in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Jesus Sotelo-Val-dovinos assisted by arranging a delivery of methamphetamine from California to Minnesota and encouraging more trafficking after the driver was arrested. Penalo-za-Romero and Sotelo-Valdovinos were indicted and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1), and 846. Each signed a plea agreement that included a waiver of the right to appeal. In relevant part, each waiver stated that the defendant \u201cwaives the right to appeal or to contest, directly or collaterally, his guilty plea or sentence on any ground, unless the sentence of imprisonment exceeds\u201d 327 months imprisonment for Penaloza-Rome-ro and 210 months imprisonment for So-telo-Valdovinos. The district court sentenced Penaloza-Romero to 196 months in prison and Sotelo-Valdovinos to 75 months in prison. Both appeal. We enforce the appeal waivers and dismiss the appeals.\nThe right to appeal may be waived through a plea agreement. United States v. Andis, 333 F.3d 886, 889 (8th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 997, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003). We review the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. United States v. Sisco, 576 F.3d 791, 795 (8th Cir. 2009). In reviewing an appeal waiver, \u201cwe must confirm that the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver and that both the waiver and plea agreement were entered into knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Andis, 333 F.3d at 889-90. Here, the change of plea hearings and plea agreements confirm that Penaloza-Romero and Sotelo-Valdovinos knowingly and voluntarily accepted the plea agreements and waived their rights to appeal. The prison sentences imposed are well within the scope of the appeal waivers. Id. at 892. However, we will not enforce an appeal waiver if doing so would result in a miscarriage of justice. Id. at 890.\nPenaloza-Romero argues the district court procedurally erred in considering grounds for a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before determining whether he should receive a departure for substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. He argues that his 196-month sentence is substantively unreasonable when the \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(a) variance factors are properly considered.. Enforcing the appeal waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice because Penaloza-Romero was sentenced to 19(3 months for an offense that could have resulted in a sentence of life imprisonment. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); Sisco, 576 F.3d at 795.\nSotelo-Valdovinos is a hechicero\u2014a spiritual healer in the Mexican Santa Muerte folk religion. As a hechicero, he provided spiritual advice to clients in California, including two who were involved in the drug trafficking. At sentencing, defense counsel emphasized Sotelo-Valdovinos\u2019s role as -a spiritual advisor in arguing for a downward variance. In explaining ,why it was denying a variance, the district court commented that, as articulated by defense counsel, Sotelo-Valdovinos \u201cgot esteem as an important spiritual leader and healer in ... a world of drug trafficking, and so I do think there is a risk that [he] might reof-fend .... [T]hat is an aggravating circumstance in this case that balances out with the mitigating circumstance.\u201d\n\u2022 Citing this comment, Sotelo-Valdovinos argues the district court abused its discretion when it impermissibly considered his Santa Muerte faith as a sentencing factor, making enforcement of his appeal waiver a miscarriage of justice. In this circuit, miscarriage of justice is an \u201cextremely narrow\u201d exception we have thus far applied only to an illegal sentence; \u201c[a]ny sentence imposed within the statutory range is not subject to appeal.\u201d Andis, 333 F.3d at 892. Some circuits have recognized, but to our knowledge never applied, the principle that basing a sentence on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race would fall within the miscarriage of justice exception. See Andis, 333 F.3d at 891, citing United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 25 n.9 & 10 (1st Cir. 2001). Here, the district court did not base its sentencing decision on Sotelo-Valdovinos\u2019s faith or religion. Rather, the court concluded that the environment in which Sotelo-Valdovinos functioned as a \u201cspiritual healer\u201d made it more likely that he would reoffend. That is a legitimate sentencing consideration. So-telo-Valdovinos\u2019s 75-month sentence was within the scope of his knowing and voluntary appeal waiver, and enforcing the waiver will not' otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice because the sentence was substantially below 210 months, the sentence above which he preserved his right to appeal.\nFor these reasons, we enforce the appeal waivers and dismiss both appeals.\n. The Honorable Susan Richard Nelson, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.",
