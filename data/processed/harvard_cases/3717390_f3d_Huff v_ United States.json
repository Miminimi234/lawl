        "text": "OPINION\nDAVID M. LAWSON, District Judge.\nDonavon Huff appeals the denial of his motion to vacate his sentence, which he filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Huff had pleaded guilty to various fraud and identity theft charges under a plea agreement in which the parties agreed, among other things, that the November 1, 2002 Sentencing Guideline Manual would be used to calculate his sentencing guideline range. The sentencing court, however, used a later version, resulting in a higher-than-anticipated range, and sentenced Huff to a longer prison term. Huff filed a direct appeal raising a viable appellate issue, but his appellate lawyer, he says, gave him bad advice and talked him into dismissing the appeal, warning that the district judge might vindictively increase Huffs sentence on remand. The district court rejected Huffs ensuing ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim without holding an evidentia-ry hearing. We believe that a hearing was necessary to address that claim properly, and it was error not to hold one. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.\nI.\nThe defendant was indicted on January 17, 2007 and charged with one count of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, one count of identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7), and five counts of access device fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2). On May 3, 2007, the defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy, identity theft, and two counts of access device fraud with the benefit of a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(B). Huff hatched his fraudulent scheme in 2001 while he was employed at an insurance company and had access to customers\u2019 account information. He used that information to obtain credit cards and other lines of credit, and he employed a juvenile to create and process fraudulent cell phone contracts using the purloined information. The loss amount exceeded $350,000.\nThe plea agreement contained a stipulation by the parties that the Sentencing Guidelines Manual that was effective on November 1, 2002 applied to Huff. The parties calculated the defendant\u2019s Chapter 2 offense level at 22, and agreed that no other sentencing guideline adjustments other than those specified in the agreement applied. The parties\u2019 calculation did not include upward adjustments for either abuse of a position of trust under Guidelines section 3B1.3 or for the use of a minor under section 3B1.4. The plea agreement stated that the court would determine the defendant\u2019s eligibility for an acceptance of responsibility adjustment on the date of sentencing, but the parties agreed that if the court followed the parties\u2019 stipulations the total adjusted offense level would be 19. The plea agreement stated that the parties had no agreement as to the applicable criminal history category and that the criminal history category would be determined by the court after completion of a pre-sentence investigation by the United States Probation Department. The plea agreement contained an acknowledgment that sentencing recommendations are not binding on the sentencing court and that the court alone was responsible for determining the applicable sentencing range, whether there was any basis to depart from that range, and what sentence to impose.\nThe pre-sentence report (PSR) was prepared on July 2, 2007. The probation officer used the 2006 version of the Sentencing Guideline Manual, but stated that the 2002 and 2006 editions produced the same offense level computations. The PSR included a two-level upward adjustment under Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.3 for abuse of a position of trust that was not stipulated in the plea agreement. The probation officer applied the abuse-of-trust enhancement, reasoning that Huff used his position at the insurance company to obtain customers\u2019 private information and then misused that data to open credit lines. The PSR also included two additional two-level upward adjustments that were not stipulated: an adjustment under Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.11(b)(2)(A) for more than ten victims and an adjustment under Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.4 for the use of a minor. The PSR stated an adjusted offense level of 28 with a net offense level of 25 after acceptance of responsibility. The PSR calculated Huffs criminal history score at four points, resulting in a Criminal History Category of III. The criminal history score was based on two prior offenses. The first offense was forgery theft, for which the plaintiff was arrested on May 14, 2003. The second offense was attempted misuse of a credit card. The second offense occurred in July 2003, and the defendant was arrested on October 31, 2003. Huff had pleaded guilty to both offenses on January 5, 2004 and was sentenced for both offenses on February 10, 2004. The resulting sentencing range was 70 to 87 months.\nHuffs attorney filed a sentencing memorandum objecting to the Criminal History Category contained in the PSR. He argued that the sentences for his two prior offenses ran concurrently with one another, and therefore should only be counted once. He also objected to the calculation of the offense level in the PSR and the application of the three two-level upward adjustments.\nAt the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor stated that the abuse-of-trust enhancement was not included in the plea agreement because the government believed that although the defendant held a supervisory position at the insurance company, his position did not add to his ability to commit the crimes. The district court asked the probation officer to comment on his application of that enhancement, and the probation officer indicated that he had used application note 2B, which states that the guideline applies to a \u201cdefendant who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position in order to obtain unlawfully or use without authority any means of identification.\u201d That language was in the 2006 Guidelines Manual, but not the 2002 version. The district court found that \u201cbased upon the rationale provided by the probation officer here in open court it\u2019s clear the defendant did abuse a position of trust based upon his position as a supervisor in the Call Center of the ... insurance [cjompany\u201d and applied the abuse-of-trust enhancement. The district court sentenced the defendant to concurrent 60-month prison terms on all counts, to be followed by three years of supervised release.\nAfter sentencing, Huffs trial counsel withdrew and Donald J. Malarcik was appointed as appellate counsel. Malarcik filed a timely notice of appeal, and raised three issues in the appellant\u2019s brief: (1) Huffs criminal history category was incorrectly calculated; (2) the upward adjustment for abuse of a position of trust was improper; and (3) the district court failed to state its reasons for the defendant\u2019s sentence with sufficient clarity to permit appellate review.\nHuff averred in a declaration that after the government filed its response brief, Malarcik contacted him and told him that if he prevailed on appeal, his case would be remanded for re-sentencing by the district court. Malarcik allegedly explained that in his experience, the district court judge was unhappy when he was reversed and would express that unhappiness by imposing a sentence substantially greater than that originally imposed. Huff says that Malarcik strongly advised him to dismiss his appeal to avoid that prospect. Huff discussed the matter with his wife, Jamila Huff. Jamila also filed a declaration in which she avers that Malarcik told her that Huff had a \u201c50-50 shot\u201d that the district court would give the defendant a longer sentence. Huff says that he reasoned that the risk of punitive re-sentencing was too great and authorized Malarcik to dismiss the appeal. But he also insists that Malarcik never told him that the law prohibited a district court from increasing a sentence on remand as punishment for a successful appeal or that the appellate court could issue a remand that limited the re-sentencing to the issues raised on appeal.\nOn December 1, 2008, Mr. Malarcik filed a motion for voluntary dismissal of the appeal, which was granted two days later.\nOn January 30, 2009, Huff filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which he amended twice. The second amended motion was accompanied by declarations by Huff and his wife. The government responded on May 20, 2010, but did not include any affidavit or statement from Mr. Malarcik. The district court denied and dismissed the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate on July 14, 2010 without conducting an evidentiary hearing. The district court made four findings on its way to its conclusion that Huff failed to allege sufficient facts to entitle him to relief or a hearing on his claim. First, the district court found that the claim that the district court incorrectly calculated the defendant\u2019s criminal history score was not cognizable on collateral review because the defendant had not shown that the alleged mistakes constituted errors so egregious as to amount to a violation of due process or that the errors had a substantial, injurious effect on the proceedings. Second, the district court held that the defendant\u2019s claims were either procedurally defaulted or precluded by the voluntary dismissal of his appeal because the defendant did not show cause excusing his default and demonstrate prejudice. Third, the district court concluded that the defendant\u2019s claims lacked merit. With respect to the defendant\u2019s argument that the government breached the plea agreement, the district court found that the government \u201cmerely illustrated that an enhancement was warranted where a defendant abuses his or her position of trust, as was the case here,\u201d and characterized the commentary to the 2006 Guidelines as illustrative. The district court also held that the application of that commentary did not result in ex post facto punishment.\nFourth, the district court found that the defendant had not demonstrated that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The court did not find credible the defendant\u2019s allegations that his appellate counsel told him that the district court would vindictively increase the defendant\u2019s sentence should he prevail on appeal. The court pointed out that appellate counsel had been practicing several years without any disciplinary actions, and emphasized that the defendant admitted that he consented to the dismissal after a discussion with his attorney. The court believed that the defendant\u2019s attorney was entitled to a strong presumption that he provided effective assistance. The court also determined that the decision to dismiss the appeal could be considered sound strategy.\nThe district court denied a certificate of appealability. However, this court granted one following Huffs timely appeal.\nII.\nWe give fresh review to the district court\u2019s denial of a motion under section 2255, except for the factual findings, which we review for clear error. Mallett v. United States, 334 F.3d 491, 497 (6th Cir.2003). The same approach applies to our consideration of alleged errors in the application of the Sentencing Guidelines, reviewing legal conclusions de novo and findings of fact for clear error. United States v. Kaminski, 501 F.3d 655, 665 (6th Cir.2007).\nIn his original appeal \u2014 which he dismissed \u2014 Huff raised three allegations of error that, he contended, rendered his sentence improper: (1) the application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement, as construed in the 2006 version of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual, was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause; (2) the district court incorrectly scored his criminal history; and (3) the government breached the plea agreement by arguing that the application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement was not clearly erroneous. He attempts to advance those same claims here, contending that his decision to dismiss the earlier appeal was based on bad advice from his appellate lawyer. The government argues that the claims are foreclosed by the dismissal of the prior appeal, and Huff has failed to offer a credible claim that his lawyer misled him.\nThe government is correct on one point. Generally, when a defendant fails to raise an issue at sentencing or on direct appeal, that issue is waived. Elzy v. United States, 205 F.3d 882, 884 (6th Cir.2000). However, a defendant may pursue waived claims through a collateral attack under section 2255 when he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse his default. Ibid. \u201cIneffective assistance of counsel can constitute cause for a procedural default.\u201d Hodges v. Colson, 711 F.3d 589, 602 (6th Cir.2013). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are properly raised in a section 2255 motion. United States v. Graham, 484 F.3d 413, 421-22 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting United States v. Aguwa, 123 F.3d 418, 423 (6th Cir.1997)).\nThe familiar two-prong test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), governs claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Towns v. Smith, 395 F.3d 251, 258 (6th Cir.2005). That standard applies to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel raised in a motion under section 2255. Ballard v. United States, 400 F.3d 404, 407 (6th Cir.2005); see also Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 396, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985) (holding that the right to effective assistance of counsel includes the right to effective assistance of appellate counsel). To show a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. An attorney\u2019s performance is deficient if \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Id. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The defendant must show \u201cthat counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The Supreme Court has \u201cdeclined to articulate specific guidelines for appropriate attorney conduct and instead [has] emphasized that the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052) (internal quotes omitted).\nHuff argues that he dismissed his first appeal because he relied on advice from his appellate attorney that was fatally flawed. He says that the discussion of the risk of facing a possibly vindictive sentencing judge who was upset by a reversal should have been tempered by an explanation of the ameliorating features of appellate law. Those, of course, would have included the well-established rule that a sentencing judge may not impose a harsher sentence after a successful appeal to punish the defendant\u2019s success, see North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969); see also United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 374, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982) (recognizing a \u201cpresumption of vindictiveness, which may be overcome only by objective information in the record justifying the increased sentence\u201d), and the appellate court\u2019s authority to limit the district court\u2019s decision on remand, see United States v. Garcia-Robles, 640 F.3d 159, 166 (6th Cir.2011); United States v. Stout, 599 F.3d 549, 555-56 (6th Cir.2010).\nThe government does not dispute that the advice would have amounted to defective performance. Instead, the government points to Huffs acknowledgment that he met with Mr. Malarcik, discussed the pros and cons of his appeal, and made a strategic decision to dismiss it. The government contends that it simply is not credible that an appellate attorney of Mr. Malarcik\u2019s experience (nineteen years) would have given the advice that Huff describes. That is the basis upon which the trial court denied the 2255 motion as well.\nThe problem with that position is that there is no evidence in the record to support it. The trial court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing, and Malarcik has not provided any explanation of the decision to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal, despite the fact that the government advised him of Huffs motion and offered him an opportunity to submit an affidavit over three years ago. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s conclusion, without analysis, that the decision to dismiss the appeal could be considered sound strategy does not hold up. It is true that \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound ... strategy.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. But it is extremely difficult to understand how the voluntary dismissal of the defendant\u2019s appeal could be considered sound strategy, especially where, as discussed below, at least one of the defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal was potentially viable. The government has not, for example, suggested that the district court committed an error in the defendant\u2019s favor that the district court would have been required to correct on remand.\nBoth the government\u2019s argument and the district court\u2019s opinion are based on the conclusion that Huffs factual allegations in his uncontradicted affidavit are not credible. \u201cIn reviewing a \u00a7 2255 motion in which a factual dispute arises, \u2018the habeas court must hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the truth of the petitioner\u2019s claims.\u2019 \u201d Valentine v. United States, 488 F.3d 325, 333 (6th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). Although no hearing is required where \u201cthe record conclusively shows that the petitioner is entitled to no relief,\u201d Arredondo v. United States, 178 F.3d 778, 782 (6th Cir.1999), and a \u201cfull blown evidentiary hearing\u201d is not required in every case, Smith v. United States, 348 F.3d 545, 550-51 (6th Cir.2003) (quoting United States v. Todaro, 982 F.2d 1025, 1030 (6th Cir.1993)), \u201c[w]here there is a factual dispute, the habeas court must hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the truth of the petitioner\u2019s claims,\u201d Turner v. United States, 183 F.3d 474, 477 (6th Cir.1999) (citing Paprocki v. Foltz, 869 F.2d 281, 287 (6th Cir.1989)). We have held that where \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s allegations \u2018cannot be accepted as true because they are contradicted by the record, inherently incredible, or conclusions rather than statements of facts,\u2019 \u201d no hearing is necessary. Arredondo, 178 F.3d at 782 (quoting Engelen v. United States, 68 F.3d 238, 240 (8th Cir.1995)). But when a defendant presents an affidavit containing \u201ca factual narrative of the events that is neither contradicted by the record nor \u2018inherently incredible\u2019 \u201d and the government offers nothing more than \u201ccontrary representations\u201d to contradict it, the defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. Valentine, 488 F.3d at 334. A decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. at 333.\nHuffs claims in this case are not contradicted by the record and they are based on factual allegations, rather than legal conclusions. Huffs affidavit does not contain \u201cmere assertion[s] of innocence\u201d; instead, it contains a narrative of the defendant\u2019s dealings with his appellate counsel. Id. at 333. The government and the district court apparently found them inherently incredible, but we do not find support for that conclusion in the record. The district court pointed to Mr. Malarcik\u2019s nineteen year career and lack of disciplinary proceedings. Certainly, appellate counsel\u2019s experience is one factor to be considered in determining whether he was ineffective; but the fact that an attorney has had a long career does not render \u201cinherently incredible\u201d the claim that the attorney might give erroneous legal advice. And in the absence of any explanation by Mr. Malarcik, there is nothing in the record that \u201cconclusively shows\u201d that the attorney\u2019s performance was not defective under prevailing professional norms. The district court abused its discretion when it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing.\nThe failure to hold an evidentiary hearing would be of no import if the alleged defective performance were inconsequential. \u201cEven when trial counsel\u2019s performance is deficient under prevailing standards, we grant relief only if \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d McPhearson v. United States, 675 F.3d 553, 563 (6th Cir.2012) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052). We therefore turn to Huffs claims of sentencing error, and we find that at least one has merit.\nHuff contends that the application of an abuse-of-trust enhancement under Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.3 was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause because it was based on an application note in the commentary to that section that was not included in the version of the Guidelines in effect at the time of his offense. He says that the amendment, which became effective on November 1, 2005, brought him within the scope of the enhancement, which would not have been applicable to him under the 2002 version of the Guidelines. The government responds that the amendment was clarifying, rather than substantive, and in any event, the application of the enhancement to Huff was not clearly erroneous.\nGenerally, a district court applies the version of the Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing. United States v. Welch, 689 F.3d 529, 532 (6th Cir.2012). However, this past term, the Supreme Court held that a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause occurs \u201cwhen a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\u201d Peugh v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 2078, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013). That decision is consistent with Sixth Circuit law on that point. See United States v. Lanham, 617 F.3d 873, 889-90 (6th Cir.2010). If the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is greater under the Guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing, the district court must apply the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense to avoid an ex post facto violation. Welch, 689 F.3d at 533.\nWe have held, however, that \u201cclarifying amendments may be applied retroactively to discern the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intent regarding the application of a pre-amendment guideline.\u201d United States v. Geerken, 506 F.3d 461, 465 (6th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). \u201cAn amendment is clarifying if it changes nothing concerning the legal effect of the guidelines, but merely clarifies what the Commission deems the guidelines to have already meant.\u201d Ibid, (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). But if the amendment can actually constitute \u201c[a] retrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable to a defendant,\u201d Peugh, 133 S.Ct. at 2085, rather than a further explanation of the Guidelines range that always was applicable to a defendant, it is substantive and, in light of Peugh, would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. To determine whether an amendment is substantive or clarifying, this Court considers three factors: \u201c \u2018(1) how the Sentencing Commission characterized the amendment; (2) whether the amendment changes the language of the guideline itself or changes only the commentary for the guideline; and (3) whether the amendment resolves an ambiguity in the original wording of the guideline.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Monus, 356 F.3d 714, 718 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting United States v. Hartz, 296 F.3d 595, 599 (7th Cir.2002)).\nThe second factor favors the conclusion that the amendment was clarifying, as it changed only the language of the comment and not the text of the Guideline provision. However, the other two factors strongly suggest the opposite conclusion. The Sentencing Commission did not characterize the amendment as a clarifying amendment. Instead, it stated that the amendment \u201cimplements sections 2 and 5 of the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act ... which ... direct the Sentencing Commission to expand the upward adjustment at \u00a7 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C at 142 (2012). Specifically addressing the application note challenged by the defendant, the Sentencing Commission indicated that the note was added \u201cin response to the directive in section 5 to amend\u201d the abuse-of-trust Guideline \u201cto include [a defendant who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position in order to obtain unlawfully or use without authority any means of identification] within the scope of the guideline.\u201d Id. at 143. That language clearly suggests that an identity theft defendant would not have been within the scope of the guideline before the amendment. There is no language by the Sentencing Commission indicating that the amendment was intended to resolve an ambiguity in the guideline language. Instead, the purpose of the amendment plainly was to bring new defendants and conduct within the scope of the enhancement. Such an amendment can hardly be considered merely \u201cclarifying.\u201d\nIn this case, the Probation Department used the 2006 version of the Guidelines, including the 2005 amendment, in calculating Huff\u2019s offense level. Moreover, in applying the enhancement, the district court relied on the probation officer\u2019s comments during the sentencing hearing, in which the probation officer quoted the 2005 amendment language. The application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement increased the defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels, from a total offense level of 23 to an offense level of 25. All other things being equal, the application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement increased the defendant\u2019s guideline range from 53 to 71 months to 70 to 87 months, a substantial increase. The amendment made the abuse-of-trust enhancement applicable to Huff on the day of his sentencing and increased his offense level \u2014 and the corresponding guideline range \u2014 over that which would have applied when he committed the crimes. \u201cSuch a retrospective increase in the measure of punishment raises clear ex post facto concerns.\u201d Peugh, 133 S.Ct. at 2085.\nAn ex post facto error may be harmless, see id. at 2088 n. 8, so we must consider two more points. First, the sentence actually imposed fell within the lower guideline range. However, a miscalculation of the range renders the sentence procedurally unreasonable. United States v. Catalan, 499 F.3d 604, 606 (6th Cir.2007) (citing United States v. Davis, 458 F.3d 491, 495 (6th Cir.2006)). We will not speculate on what sentence the district court would have imposed had it correctly calculated the defendant\u2019s offense level. Welch, 689 F.3d at 534.\nSecond, the government appears to argue, although it is not entirely clear, that the abuse-of-trust enhancement was appropriate because the district court determined that Huff abused his position of trust. But that determination quite clearly was based on the 2006 amendment to the commentary. At sentencing, the district court relied on the probation officer\u2019s comments, in which the officer quoted the 2006 amendment language; in its memorandum opinion denying the defendant\u2019s 2255 motion, the district court acknowledged that it \u201cemployed a two-level upward adjustment pursuant to the Commentary to Section 3B1.3 of the 2006 Edition, which did not appear in the 2002 Edition.\u201d R. 108 Memorandum Opinion at 8. The ex post facto error here cannot be considered harmless.\nHuff raises other sentencing errors as well, but we do not find them persuasive. The district court did not mis-score Huffs criminal history. The two crimes properly were counted separately because there was an intervening arrest. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) & cmt. app. note (2002). Nor did the prosecutor breach the plea agreement by defending the sentence on appeal. The fact that the government agreed to a sentencing adjustment before the district court does not mean that the government is estopped from arguing on appeal that the district court did not err in declining to award the adjustment. United States v. Rodriguez-Castro, 641 F.3d 1189, 1192 (9th Cir.2011); see also United States v. Thornberg, 326 F.3d 1023, 1025 n. 3 (8th Cir.2003); United States v. Nathan, 188 F.3d 190, 213 n. 11 (3d Cir.1999).\nHowever, because of the ex post facto error, there is a substantial likelihood that had the defendant not dismissed his appeal, the outcome would have been different. That satisfies the prejudice prong of the Strickland inquiry.\nIII.\nWe must conclude that Huffs allegations of defective performance by his appellate lawyer are not inherently incredible, nor are they contradicted by the record. Because there is nothing in the record that \u201cconclusively shows\u201d that Huffs ineffective assistance claim lacks merit, and because Huff has demonstrated prejudice, we must remand the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on whether appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Therefore, the district court\u2019s order denying Huffs motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",
