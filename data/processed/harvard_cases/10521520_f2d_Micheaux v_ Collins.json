        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nThe court having heard and considered this case en banc, we now affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. However, the panel opinion, Micheaux v. Collins, 911 F.2d 1083 (5th Cir.1990), remains vacated pursuant to Fifth Circuit Local Rule 41.3 and our Internal Operating Procedure following Fed.R.App.Proc. 35.\nThe petitioner asserts that the convicting court\u2019s misinformation about the sentence he could receive following his guilty plea rendered the plea involuntary and unintelligent. On remand from a previous unpublished opinion of this court, however, the magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing and found that under the totality of the circumstances, petitioner\u2019s plea was voluntary. McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 765, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1446, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). The district court adopted this analysis and denied relief.\nPetitioner now contends that as a federal habeas court, we are bound under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) to accept the state habeas trial court\u2019s \u201cproposed findings\u201d that if Micheaux had been told of a fifteen-year minimum sentence he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. In the unusual circumstances of this case, we disagree. Not only were the \u201cproposed findings\u201d not adopted nor incorporated in the action of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, they are directly inconsistent with that court\u2019s peremptory denial of relief. We conclude that those proposed findings did not survive scrutiny by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the final decisionmaker in Texas habeas cases. See Texas Code Crim.Proc.Ann. art. 11.07, \u00a7 3.\nIn these circumstances, it was proper for the federal court to conduct a hearing de novo on the voluntariness of Micheaux\u2019s guilty plea. We have reviewed its conclusions, both on the voluntariness issue and the related claim of ineffective counsel, and we agree with it.\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n. This case is thus distinguishable from Craker v. Procunier, 756 F.2d 1212, 1213 (5th Cir.1985), aff'd. foll. rem., Craker v. McCotter, 805 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.1986), in which the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \"did not reject the factual findings of the state [trial] court; it merely held that the facts as found did not entitle Craker to relief.\" 756 F.2d at 1214 (emphasis added).",
