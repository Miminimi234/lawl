        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nAppellant Gene Szalkiewicz appeals his convictions for four counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Szalkiewicz claims he was improperly convicted of multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) based on his possession of multiple weapons on the same date. We agree and reverse.\nOn October 26, 1989, federal agents seized five machine guns, five silencers and nine pistols and revolvers from the appellant\u2019s apartment in Phoenix, Arizona. Szalkiewicz, a convicted felon, admitted to possession of the weapons. The indictment charged Szalkiewicz with numerous firearms violations. Counts XII and XV through XVIII of the indictment, at issue here, alleged possession of several firearms by Szalkiewicz on or about October 26, 1989, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Szalkiewicz was convicted by a jury of all counts, and was sentenced to 24 months in prison and ordered to pay a fine and costs.\nThis court has held that only one offense is charged for possession of firearms by a felon, regardless of the number of firearms involved, absent a showing that the firearms were stored or acquired at different times and places. United States v. Wiga, 662 F.2d 1325, 1336 (9th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 918, 102 S.Ct. 1775, 72 L.Ed.2d 178 (1982). Szalkiewicz filed a motion to arrest judgment after his sentencing. Szalkiewicz claimed that counts XII and XV through XVIII were multiplicitous because they alleged possession of several firearms on the same date. The government contended that because the record contained evidence that Szalkiewicz had acquired the weapons separately, the multiple counts could stand. The district court denied Szalkiewicz\u2019s motion to arrest judgment and he now appeals.\nIn Wiga, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s multiple convictions for possession of firearms by a convicted felon pursuant to 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). We did so not only because the evidence demonstrated that the weapons were purchased at different times and different places, but also because the indictment alleged \u201cthe separate and distinct acts of acquisition\u201d and because the separate and distinct acquisitions were presented to the jury. Id. at 1336-37.\nOther circuits have held that the jury must be instructed to find separate acquisition or possession for multiple convictions to stand. See, e.g., United States v. Valentine, 706 F.2d 282, 294 (10th Cir.1983) (overturning multiplicitous convictions where jury did not find separate possession or acquisition, despite uncontroverted evidence indicating weapons were delivered separately); United States v. Frankenberry, 696 F.2d 239, 245 (3d Cir.1982) (vacating sentence based on multiplicitous convictions where indictment charged possession of weapons on or about same date, where evidence did not establish separate possession or acquisition, and where no jury finding regarding non-simultaneous possession), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1210, 103 S.Ct. 3544, 77 L.Ed.2d 1392 (1983). We agree with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s statement in United States v. Valentine:\nThe problem with the Government\u2019s theory is that, although there was uncon-troverted evidence of separate delivery of the two guns, the jury did not find and was not asked to find that there had been, indeed, two separate acts. Under the cases relied upon by the Government, separate receipt is a necessary element for multiple convictions under both section 922 and section 1202. It is therefore axiomatic that the defendant has a right to a jury finding on this essential issue.\nValentine, 706 F.2d at 294.\nBecause the jury made no finding of fact as to separate acquisition or possession, Szalkiewicz\u2019s multiple convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) cannot stand. We therefore vacate appellant\u2019s convictions on counts XV, XVI, XVII and XVIII of the indictment.\nThe district court\u2019s denial of Szalkiew-icz\u2019s motion to arrest judgment with respect to Counts XV, XVI, XVII and XVIII is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.",
