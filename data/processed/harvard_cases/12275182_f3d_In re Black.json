        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAdarus Mazio Black, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, moves for authorization to proceed with a second or successive motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has also moved for a certificate of appealability.\nBlack was convicted in separate jury trials of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and maryuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and escape or attempted escape from federal custody, in violation of 18 U.S.C; \u00a7 -751(a). The.district court sentenced him to an effective term of life in prison. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. United States v. Black, 465 Fed.Appx. 510. (6th Cir. 2012). In 2013, Black sought relief under \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the motion to vacate and refused to issue a certificate of appealability.\nIn 2017, Black filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), seeking relief from the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Black argued that relief was warranted for five reasons: (1) the district count misapplied the law as to his claim that his trial counsel had a conflict of interest; (2) the district court misapplied the law as to his claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in connection with a plea offer; (3) the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 2255 motion prior to receiving a supplemental brief; (4)\nthe government committed fraud upon the court -during his criminal trial; and (5) the district court erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing. The district court determined- that the first, second, and fourth grounds for relief were second or successive claims under \u00a7 2255. and transferred them to this court for a determination of whether Black may proceed. The district court otherwise denied Black\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.\nIn this case, we must decide whether the district court properly transferred Black\u2019s first, second, and fourth grounds for 60(b) relief to this court as second or successive \u201cclaims\u201d under \u00a7 2255. In re Nailor, 487 F.3d 1018, 1021-23 (6th Cir. 2007). It did if Black sought to add a new ground for relief or attacked the district court\u2019s merits decision. See Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). It did not if he merely attacked a defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings. Id.\nThe first two grounds for relief are easy: Black argues that the district court \u201capplied the wrong standard\u201d or \u201capplied the wrong doctrine\u201d to his arguments about trial counsel\u2019s conflicts of interest and ineffective assistance. A.R. 13 at 5-6. Those arguments are prototypical \u201cattacks [on] the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of [the] claim[s] on the'-merits.\u201d Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641 (emphasis original).\nThe remaining ground is more complicated. Black argues that the Assistant U.S. Attorney \u201cperpetrated fraud on the Court\u201d before and during his criminal trial. See A.R. 13 at 7, 19-22. To be sure, Gonzalez states that fraud on the court \u201cis one example of ... a defect\u201d in federal habeas proceedings. 545 U.S. at 532 n.5, 125 S.Ct. 2641. But it referred to \u201c[fjraud on the federal habeas court.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Because Black\u2019s fraud-on-the-court argument concerns only the prosecutor\u2019s conduct during his trial, -he has not called into question \u201cthe integrity of the- federal habeas proceedings.\u201d Id. at 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641. - Every - Circuit that-has addressed this question agrees. See Pizzuto v. Ramirez, 783 F.3d 1171, 1180-81 (9th Cir. 2015); Spitznas v. Boone, 464 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir. 2006); cf. Fierro v. Johnson, 197 F.3d 147, 153-54 (5th Cir. 1999); United States v. MacDonald, 161 F.3d 4, at *3 (4th Cir. 1998) (Table) (AEDPA does \u201cnot .prevent a party who had previously filed a habeas petition from asserting that a prior petition had been denied based on fraud, unless the grounds for fraud themselves should have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d).\n. Black does not argue that the allegedly fraudulent conduct during the trial proceedings tainted the district court\u2019s assessment of his federal habeas petition, for example, because government lawyers incorporated tainted trial-court evidence into the habeas-court record. But even if he did, we have rejected such a fraud-by-incorporation theory before. See Thompkins v. Berghuis, 509 Fed.Appx. 517, 519-20 (6th Cir. 2013); see also Carter v. Anderson, 585 F.3d 1007, 1011 (6th Cir. 2009) (noting that fraud on the court requires proof that fraudulent conduct was willfully \u201cdirected to\u201d the court that was deceived).\nBecause the three transferred grounds for relief raise'successive claims, we must also decide whether to authorize Black to proceed with those claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), 2255(h). We cannot do so. First, - Black admits that he, has already presented his two trial counsel claims. A look.at his first \u00a7 2255 petition-confirms that. See R. 241 at 26-27 (conflict of interest), 33-34 (ineffective plea assistance). Because Black \u201cpresented [these claims] in a prior application,\u201d they \u201cshall be dismissed.\u201d 28 U.S.C, 2244(b)(1). Second, Black has not made a prima facie showing that his fraud-on-the-court claim relies on \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court\u201d or \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that would be sufficient to establish that \u201cno reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Indeed, he concedes that all three of his claims \u201cdo not meet the criteria of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, as [they are] not [based on] newly discovered evidence, or a new rule of law.\u201d A.R. 14 at 1; see also A.R. 16 at 3.\nAccordingly, we DENY Black\u2019s motion for authorization to proceed with a second or successive motion to vacate and his motion for a certificate of appealability.",
