        "text": "OPINION\nBORMAN, District Judge.\nGregory Alec Phillips, a former federal prisoner now on supervised release, was indicted on December 7, 2004, in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Tennessee. (R. 3, Sealed Indictment.) The one-count indictment charged that on or about November 2004, Phillips, an adult citizen of the United States, did travel in foreign commerce to Thailand, and did knowingly engage in illicit sexual conduct as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2423(f) and 2246, with a minor male person who had not attained the age of sixteen (16) years, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c). Phillips pleaded guilty to the single count and was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment, which he has served, and to lifetime supervised release. Phillips was released from prison on August 16, 2007. Subsequently, Phillips violated multiple terms of his supervised release and was sentenced to an additional 30 months imprisonment and thereafter to a 20 year term of supervised release. Phillips was released from his second incarceration in or about September, 2010, and continues on supervised release.\nPhillips now appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to vacate judgment filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In his motion to vacate in the district court, Phillips argued that the statute under which he was convicted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c), which punishes \u201c[ejngaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places,\u201d applied only to individuals who both traveled in foreign commerce and engaged in illicit sexual conduct after the statute was enacted on April 30, 2003. Phillips also argued that his conviction violated the Ex Post Facto clause. Declining to address the government\u2019s arguments that Phillips\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was time-barred and procedurally defaulted, the district court addressed the merits and ruled that Phillips\u2019s foreign travel need not have preceded the date of enactment of section 2423(c), as long as the illicit sexual conduct occurred after the statute was enacted, which in Phillips\u2019s ease it did. The district court denied the motion to vacate, and denied Phillips a certificate of appealability. Phillips v. United States, No. 04-cr-179, 2011 WL 4436526 (E.D.Tenn. Sept. 23, 2011). This Court granted Phillips\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, on the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c) requires that both the travel and the illicit sexual conduct occur after enactment of the statute criminalizing engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places. After oral argument, this Court requested supplemental briefing addressing whether the equitable exception for actual innocence to AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations applies in this case, in light of the absence of new evidence, and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in McQuiggin v. Perkins, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013). For reasons not addressed by the district court, but addressed by the parties in the supplemental briefs, which we find dispositive of Phillips\u2019s claims, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court denying Phillips\u2019s motion to vacate judgment.\nI.\nA. The PROTECT Act\nTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c), which was enacted on April 30, 2003, as part of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cthe PROTECT Act\u201d), defined as \u201cAN ACT To prevent child abduction and the sexual exploitation of children, and for other purposes,\u201d provides:\n\u201cIllicit sexual conduct\u201d is defined as:\n(1) a sexual act (as defined in section 2246) with a person under 18 years of age that would be in violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States; or (2) any commercial sex act (as defined in section 1591) with a person under 18 years of age.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(f). See Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003).\nSection 2423(c) originally was proposed as one of a number of amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423, as part of the Sex Tourism Prohibition Improvement Act of 2002. H.R. REP. 107-525 (June 24, 2002), 2002 WL 1376220 (2002). Ultimately, the amendments proposed as part of the Sex Tourism Prohibition Improvement Act of 2002 became law as part of the PROTECT Act in 2003, replacing the single section (b), which punished travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, with new subsections (b) through (g). Subsection (b), \u201cTravel With Intent to Engage in Illicit Sexual Conduct,\u201d remained essentially unchanged and subsections (c) through (g) were newly added. Subsection (c), \u201cEngaging in Illicit Sexual Conduct in Foreign Places,\u201d under which Phillips was indicted in this case, has no intent requirement and punishes one who travels in foreign commerce and engages in illicit sexual conduct with another person.\nB. Phillips\u2019s Conviction, Supervised Release Violations and Motion to Vacate\nIn August, 2001, Phillips traveled from the United States to Thailand to begin employment as a teacher at the American School of Bangkok, in Bangkok, Thailand. At the time he decided to travel to Thailand to seek employment as a teacher, Phillips had just completed 36 months probation following a 1998 conviction in Mecklenburg, North Carolina, for taking indecent liberties with a child. Because Phillips was prohibited from seeking employment as teacher in the United States, he decided to move to Thailand and find work there teaching children. At all times relevant to this action, Phillips remained a citizen of the United States, although he had obtained the necessary legal authorization to reside and work in Thailand. Beginning in or about May, 2004 (or earlier), and continuing through October, 2004, Phillips lived at his residence in Bangkok with a Thai national child named Prasert Ketbuakaew, also known as \u201cOng,\u201d who was over thirteen but under sixteen years of age during that period of time.\nOn or about October 26, 2004, the United States Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) in Bangkok, Thailand, sought the assistance of the Royal Thai Police in obtaining a search warrant for Phillips\u2019s residence on suspicion that Phillips was violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c), \u201cEngaging in Illicit Sexual Contact in Foreign Places.\u201d (R. 46-M at 4-6, United States Supplemental Filing to the Response to the Defendants\u2019 Motion to Suppress Thai Search Warrant, Ex. 4, October 26, 2004 Letter from Mark Robinson, Attache for ICE in Bangkok, to Surat Udomrat, Royal Thai Police Colonel.) The ICE request to Police Colonel Udomrat set forth, in pertinent part, the following investigative findings:\nThrough investigation and surveillance from March 2004 to the present, this office\u2019s Special Agents and Investigators have learned that Mr. Phillips is allegedly involved in the sexual exploitation and/or endangerment of children. This information was initially developed when the American School of Bangkok (ASB) informed that Mr. Phillips was formerly teaching there until he was released based upon his suspicious behavior with the school children.\nThe ASB\u2019s staff reported that Mr. Phillips was particularly interested with the school\u2019s boys as exhibited by his frequent public displays of inappropriate physical contact with them on school grounds.... After interviewing some of [the staff at Phillips\u2019s former Bangkok residence], it was learned that Mr. Phillips regularly brought different \u201cyoung Thai boys\u201d to his apartment to spend the night. One of the boys was nicknamed or identified as \u201cOng,\u201d the alleged victim.... When Mr. Phillips moved out of [his former residence] it was determined through multiple sur-veillances conducted at different times such as mornings, afternoons, and evenings that Ong was inside [Mr. Phillips\u2019s] residence. It was learned that he was approximately thirteen years old. R. 46-4 at 5. Based upon this, and other pertinent information learned through further investigation and surveillance, the search warrant was granted, the search was conducted and Ong was removed from the residence and transferred to child protection officers.\nAlthough it is unclear how Mr. Phillips became aware that authorities were searching for him in Thailand in connection with these charges, according to testimony of his probation officer in connection with Phillips\u2019s supervised release revocation hearing on March 28, 2008, Phillips did become aware that he was being sought and did flee Thailand sometime in October, 2004, to Mexico, where he stayed for approximately 30 days with a former acquaintance, whom Phillips knew as \u201cDylan Thomas,\u201d a convicted sex offender whose actual name was John Schillaci, who was then listed on the FBI\u2019s Top Ten Most Wanted individuals. According to the testimony of Phillips\u2019s probation officer at the revocation hearing, at some point, after residing in Mexico for a period of approximately 30 days, Phillips voluntarily returned to the United States. On December 7, 2004, Phillips was indicted on charges of knowingly engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor male, Ong, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c).\nOn May 17, 2005, Phillips entered into a Rule 11 Plea Agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the single count with which he was charged, engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c). On September 28, 2005, the district court sentenced Phillips to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and a life term of supervised release. Phillips did not appeal his sentence and remained in federal custody at the Federal Correctional Institution, Jessup, Georgia until his release on August 15, 2007.\nOn February 20, 2008, Phillips\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court for a warrant for Phillips arrest for multiple violations of his supervised release. The warrant was issued that same day and executed on February 26, 2008. Phillips waived his right to a preliminary hearing and detention hearing and was ordered detained without bail pending his revocation hearing before the district court. The district court held the revocation hearing on March 28, 2008 and found Phillips to be in violation of both his standard and special conditions of supervised release. The district court sentenced Phillips to an additional 30 months incarceration followed by 20 years of supervised release with additional special conditions. Phillips appealed his sentence to this Court and, on March 22, 2010, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that Phillips violated the terms of his supervised release and affirmed in all respects the sentence imposed by the district court upon revocation of his supervised release. United States v. Phillips, 370 Fed.Appx. 610 (6th Cir.2010). Phillips completed his second incarceration in September, 2010, and continues to serve his 20-year term of supervised release.\nJust days before his February 26, 2008, arrest for violation of the terms of his supervised release, Phillips had filed in the district court a Motion to Vacate Judgment Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking to vacate his original conviction entered by the district court on September 28, 2005. Recognizing that his motion was filed nearly two and a half years beyond the applicable one-year statute of limitations, Phillips argued that he was entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) because the earliest date on which he could have discovered the grounds for his motion was March 29, 2007, the date on which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided United States v. Jackson, 480 F.Sd 1014 (9th Cir.2007), which Phillips argues establishes that the \u201ctravel\u201d in foreign commerce required under \u00a7 2423(c) must have occurred after the statute was enacted on April 30, 2003. Phillips argued in his motion to vacate that \u201c[c]learly the interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423 changed effective March 29, 2007.\u201d (R. 72, Memorandum in Support of Mot. to Vacate at 2, PgID# 8.) Although it is undisputed that the illicit sexual conduct with the minor male Ong, to which Phillips pleaded guilty, occurred after the enactment of section 2423(c), Phillips argued that his \u201ctravel\u201d ended in August, 2001, when he began residing in Thailand and teaching at the American School in Bangkok. Therefore, Phillips argued, because his travel occurred before 2423(c) was enacted, this change in the law rendered him actually innocent or rendered his actions not a violation of law. Phillips also argued that application of 2423(c) to him violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nThe Government filed a motion to dismiss Phillips\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely because it was not filed within one year of his conviction and did not meet any of the criteria for avoiding the one-year limitation period found in \u00a7 2255(f). Jackson, the government argued, was not a change in the substantive law by the United States Supreme Court interpreting \u00a7 2423(c) and the Sixth Circuit had issued no prece-dential opinion on the issue. The district court did not rule immediately on these motions.\nOn June 10, 2010, while still serving his 30 month prison term for violation of his supervised release, Phillips filed a Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of his 2008 Motion to Vacate, which had not yet been ruled upon by the district court. The Supplemental Memorandum brought to the district court\u2019s attention, as additional evidence of a purported change in the law indicating Phillips\u2019s actual innocence, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Carr v. United States, 560 U.S. 438, 130 S.Ct. 2229, 176 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010). In Carr, the Supreme Court held that the provisions of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSOR-NA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250, that imposed criminal sanctions on convicted sex offenders for failing to register when they travel in interstate commerce, did not apply to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred before SORNA\u2019s effective date.\nAlthough the issue of the timeliness of Phillips\u2019s motion was extensively briefed in the district court, that court declined to address the issue in its ruling on Phillips\u2019s motion to vacate and instead rested its decision on statutory interpretation grounds. After hearing oral argument, this Court sought supplemental briefing on the issue of the timeliness of Phillips\u2019s motion. We now find the timeliness issue dispositive of Phillips\u2019s claims in this case. We therefore AFFIRM the district court on this alternate basis and do not reach the merits of Phillips\u2019s argument challenging the district court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ctravels\u201d as used in \u00a7 2423(c).\nII.\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we review legal issues de novo and uphold factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Adams v. United States, 622 F.3d 608, 610-11 (6th Cir.2010). Specifically, \u201c[t]his Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on the issue of equitable tolling de novo where the facts are undisputed.\u201d Solomon v. United States, 467 F.3d 928, 932 (6th Cir.2006).\nIII.\nThe statute of limitations governing the filing of a \u00a7 2255 motion is set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) and provides:\nA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014\n(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;\n(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;\n(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or\n(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f).\nPhillips first suggests that his petition is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(4) because a \u201cnew fact\u201d was discovered when the Ninth Circuit decided Jackson and \u201cclarified the scope of \u00a7 2423(c)\u2019s travel prong.\u201d (Pet\u2019r\u2019s Supp. Br. 4.) Phillips concludes that because he filed his petition within one year of the Jackson decision, his petition is timely. Id. But as Phillips also recognizes, \u00a7 2255(f)(4) is directed at the discovery of new facts, not newly-discovered law, and his is not such a case. The heart of Phillips\u2019s argument is not that his petition should be considered timely but that an equitable exception should be applied to \u201cbypass the statutory bar erected by the AEDPA,\u201d because an intervening change in the law has rendered him actually innocent. (Pet\u2019r\u2019s Supp. Br. 5-6.)\nIn McQuiggin v. Perkins, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013), the Supreme Court recently discussed the actual innocence exception in the context of state petitioner\u2019s untimely filing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, describing the actual innocence exception as a \u201c \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice exception, [ ] grounded in the \u2018equitable discretion\u2019 of habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.\u2019 \u201d 133 S.Ct. at 1931 (quoting Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993)). Although the Court in McQuiggin addressed an evidentiary \u201cfactual\u201d actual innocence claim, i.e. the petitioner claimed that newly discovered facts established his innocence, the Court drew upon its reasoning in several decisions, including Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), which recognized a fundamental miscarriage of justice exception in the procedural default context:\nThe miscarriage of justice exception, our decisions bear out, survived AEDPA\u2019s passage. In Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998), we applied the exception to hold that a federal court may, consistent with AEDPA, recall its mandate in order to revisit the merits of a decision. Id., at 558, 118 S.Ct. 1489 (\u201cThe miscarriage of justice standard is altogether consistent ... with AEDPA\u2019s central concern that the merits of concluded criminal proceedings not be revisited in the absence of a strong showing of actual innocence.\u201d). In Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), we held, in the context of \u00a7 2255, that actual innocence may overcome a prisoner\u2019s failure to raise a constitutional objection on direct review. Most recently, in House [v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006)], we reiterated that a prisoner\u2019s proof of actual innocence may provide a gateway for federal habeas review of a procedurally defaulted claim of constitutional error. 547 U.S. at 537-538, 126 S.Ct. 2064.\nThese decisions \u201csee[k] to balance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.\u201d Schlup [v. Delo ], 513 U.S. [298 (1995)], at 324, 115 S.Ct. 851 [130 L.Ed.2d 808], Sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.\n133 S.Ct. at 1932 (alterations to text in original).\nBousley thus properly informs the analysis of an actual innocence claim in the statute of limitations context. See also Souter v. Jones, 395 F.3d 577, 590, 590 n. 5 (6th Cir.2005) (finding a credible, claim of actual innocence based upon newly discovered evidence sufficient to equitably toll the one year statute limitations set forth in \u00a7 2244(d)(1), noting the teachings of Bousley and observing that \u201cthe interests that must be balanced in creating an exception to the statute of limitations are identical to those implicated in the procedural default context ...\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Bousley established an analytical framework for addressing actual innocence claims based upon a claim of legal innocence occasioned by an intervening change in law. See, e.g. Wooten v. Cauley, 677 F.3d 303, 307 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe Sixth Circuit has derived its understanding of the definition of \u2018actual innocence\u2019 from Bousley [].\u201d) In Wooten, examining a Bousley actual innocence claim in the context of a challenge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, via \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, this Court observed:\nBousley held that \u201c[t]o establish actual innocence, petitioner must demonstrate that, in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him ... [and] that \u2018actual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d 523 U.S. at 623-24, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). One way to establish factual innocence is to show an \u201cintervening change in the law that establishes [the petitioner\u2019s] actual innocence.\u201d [United States v.] Peterman, 249 F.3d [458 (6th Cir.2001) ] at 462. This may be achieved by demonstrating (1) the existence of a new interpretation of statutory law, (2) which was issued after the petitioner had a meaningful time to incorporate the new interpretation into his direct appeals or subsequent motions, (3) is retroactive, and (4) applies to the merits of the petition to make it more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\n677 F.3d at 307-08 (alterations to text in original). Phillips\u2019s claim fails at the first prong of this analysis. Neither this Circuit nor the Supreme Court has issued any \u201cnew decisions interpreting [\u00a7 2423(c)] that substantively define\u201d the criminal offense contained in that section. Id. at 308 (quoting Garland v. Roy, 615 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2010)).\nPhillips begins his actual innocence argument with the premise that his conduct was not criminal under \u00a7 2423(c) because his travel occurred pre-enactment. But Phillips never addresses the threshold question, dispositive here, of what Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit precedent defines the temporal scope of \u00a7 2423(c) in such a way that he now stands convicted of a crime that the law does not deem criminal. Such a showing is the gravamen of an actual innocence claim. See Waucaush v. United States, 380 F.3d 251, 254 (6th Cir.2004) (recognizing that Bousley established that procedural default can be excused and a guilty plea challenged under \u201csubsequent decisions of [the Supreme Court] holding that a substantive federal criminal statute does not reach certain conduct\u201d) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) (holding that a change in the law of the circuit of conviction, interpreting Supreme Court precedent, that occurs post trial and appeal, can be asserted in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding to argue that the conduct of conviction was not a violation of the law when committed and should be set aside); Logan v. United States, 434 F.3d 503, 508 (6th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201c[p]etitioners bringing motions under \u00a7 2255 can rely on the [Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions grounded in statutory law\u201d) (alterations added).\nNeither Jackson nor Carr represents an intervening change in the law that establishes in this Court that Phillips was actually innocent of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place in violation of \u00a7 2423(c). In Jackson, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 2423(c), in particular the use of the present tense in the verbs \u201ctravels\u201d and \u201cengages,\u201d suggested that Congress specified the temporal reach of the statute and that \u00a7 2423(c) only applied if both the travel and the illicit sex act took place after the enactment of the PROTECT Act. 480 F.3d at 1018. While Jackson interprets the substantive elements of \u00a7 2423(c), it is not precedent in this Court. See Peveler v. United States, 269 F.3d 693, 699 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cWe, of course, are not bound by a decision from another circuit.\u201d). Were Phillips making his actual innocence argument in the Ninth Circuit, he might have some basis for arguing an intervening change in the law. He is not.\nIn Carr, the Supreme Court defined the substantive elements of a different criminal statute that also utilizes the term \u201ctravels.\u201d Phillips argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Carr, interpreting the term \u201ctravels\u201d as used in \u00a7 2250(a) of SORNA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a), to be prospective only, established new law mandating a similar interpretation of the word \u201ctravels\u201d in \u00a7 2423(c). Central to the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ctravels\u201d in Carr, was the fact that both Carr and the government agreed \u201cthat the elements of \u00a7 2250 should be read sequentially.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2235. The determination that SORNA required that the statutory elements must be \u201csatisfied in sequence\u201d led inescapably to the conclusion that a person first be \u201crequired to register under SORNA,\u201d before traveling in interstate commerce and failing to register, in order for criminal liability to attach under the statute: \u201cOnce a person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, which can occur only after the statute\u2019s effective date, that person can be convicted under \u00a7 2250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.\u201d Id. at 2236. Because a person could only be \u201crequired to register\u201d under SORNA after the statute was enacted, the Court held, the interstate travel must also occur post-enactment. Id. The Court noted that the context of \u00a7 2250(a) did not suggest that Congress intended to achieve, in that particular section of SORNA, a broader sweep, i.e. one that attempted to capture pre-enactment travel. Id. at 2238. Additionally, the Court in Carr noted that the legislative history relied upon by the government to support its broader reading of \u00a7 2250(a) in fact related to the goals of SORNA as a whole, not those specific to \u00a7 2250. In fact, the Court noted, the legislative history contained specific comments that \u00a7 2250 was not intended to reach \u201cpre-enactment interstate travel,\u201d despite the statute\u2019s broader underlying goals. Id. at 2241-42.\nWe recognize that Justice Sotomayor, the author of Carr, in dicta in a footnote, refers to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Jackson as an example of a similar \u201csensible\u201d reading of the statutory term \u201ctravels:\u201d\nExamining a criminal law with a travel element similar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently agreed that \u201cthe present tense verb \u2018travels,\u2019 most sensibly read, does not refer to travel that occurred in the past \u2014 that is, before the enactment of the statute.\u201d United States v. Jackson, 480 F.3d 1014, 1019 (C.A.9 2007) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c), which imposes criminal penalties on \u201c[a]ny United States citizen ... who travels in foreign commerce, and engages in illicit sexual conduct with another person.\u201d)\n130 S.Ct. at 2236 n. 5 (alteration in original). However, beyond pointing out that both \u00a7 2250(a) and \u00a7 2423(c) are criminal statutes and both use the term \u201ctravels,\u201d Justice Sotomayor offers no analysis of the \u201csimilarities,\u201d engages in no further discussion of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Jackson, and undertakes no analysis of the structure or design of \u00a7 2423(c) that might distinguish it (or not) from \u00a7 2250(a). Thus, Carr is not precedent defining the substantive criminal elements of \u00a7 2423(c). SORNA and the PROTECT Act are different statutes and this Court cannot presume that the Supreme Court in Carr, by way of citation to Jackson in a footnote, meant also to define the substantive criminal elements of \u00a7 2423(c), a different statute, adopted in a different context and for a different purpose. Had Jackson been a decision of this Circuit, or had Carr interpreted \u00a7 2423(c) of the PROTECT Act instead of \u00a7 2250(a) of SORNA, Phillips may have at least a colorable claim that he satisfies the first prong of his actual innocence argument. See, e.g., Davis, 417 U.S. at 346-47, 94 S.Ct. 2298 (holding that a change in the law of the circuit of conviction, interpreting Supreme Court precedent, that occurs post trial and appeal, can be asserted in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding to argue that the conduct of conviction was not a violation of the law when committed and should be vacated); Waucaush, 380 F.3d at 254 (finding an intervening change in the law sufficient to support an actual innocence claim where two Supreme Court decisions issued after petitioner\u2019s plea \u201cbroke new ground\u201d by redefining the scope of Congress\u2019s power under the commerce clause and placing out of reach the very category of conduct to which petitioner pleaded guilty under, compelling a conclusion that petitioner had pleaded guilty under RICO to conduct which was not a crime); Buffin v. United States, 513 Fed.Appx. 441, 444 (6th Cir.2013) (finding the first prong of the actual innocence inquiry satisfied where this Court had already held that a Supreme Court decision interpreting the very statute under review constituted \u201ca new interpretation of statutory law\u201d).\nJackson is a Ninth Circuit case, and Carr interprets SORNA, not the PROTECT Act. While both may be authority for arguing in a different context that the word \u201ctravels\u201d should be similarly interpreted in both SORNA and the PROTECT Act, neither represents an intervening change in the law that could serve as a basis for an equitable exception argument in this Court that Phillips \u201cstands convicted \u2018of an act that the law does not make criminal.\u2019 \u201d Logan, 434 F.3d at 509 (quoting Bousley, 523 U.S. at 620, 118 S.Ct. 1604). Surely the actual innocence exception, so narrowly construed that it has historically been applied with great caution and only in the case of a fundamental miscarriage of justice, cannot be so broadly defined as to be premised upon changes in statutory interpretation that may be appealing in argument, but are certainly not binding. Phillips has failed to identify a binding holding of the Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit interpreting the substantive element of \u201ctravels\u201d in \u00a7 2423(c), a necessary component of his entitlement to seek an actual innocence equitable exception to his untimely petition.\nIV.\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court denying Phillips\u2019s motion to vacate judgment.\n. Unless otherwise indicated the designation \"R._\u201d indicates the Docket Entry Number on the District Court Docket, Case No. 04-cr-00179 (E.D.Tenn.).\n. Section 2423(c) thus covers both non-commercial (subsection (f)(1)), and commercial (subsection (f)(2)), illicit sexual conduct. United States v. Bianchi, 386 Fed.Appx. 156, 162 (3d Cir.2010), cert denied, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1044, 178 L.Ed.2d 864 (2011) (noting that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\u2019s broad interpretation of the Foreign Commerce Clause applies with equal force to the non-commercial sexual conduct prong of \u00a7 2423(c),\u201d and finding that Bianchi did not establish that Congress had exceeded its constitutional bounds by enacting the non-commercial prong).\n. On March 7, 2013, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c) was amended to add, after the word \"commerce,\u201d the following language: \"or resides, either temporarily or permanently, in a foreign country.\u201d Section 2423(c) now reads:\n(c) Engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places. Any United States citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce or resides, either temporarily or permanently, in a foreign country, and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\nPub.L. 113-9 (enacted March 7, 2013). In response to this Court\u2019s June 3, 2013 letter requesting the parties to file supplemental briefs on the significance of this amendment to Phillips\u2019s appeal, Phillips responded that \"the amendment has no relevance to the instant appeal\u201d and has \"no bearing on this appeal.\u201d (June 17, 2013 Supplemental Brief of Appellant 1, 2.)\n.The details of Phillips activities while in Bangkok, and the specifics of his various supervised release violations that resulted in his second incarceration, are set forth in this Court\u2019s prior opinion and order affirming the sentence imposed by the district court for Phillips's violation of the terms of his supervised release. United States v. Phillips, 370 Fed.Appx. 610, 612-16 (6th Cir.2010).\n. According to the PSR, Phillips met Ong\u2019s mother, a hot dog vendor on the streets of Bangkok, who asked Phillips to care for her son (Ong) after she lost her job. Phillips later hired several members of Ong\u2019s family, who were unemployed, to work at a martial arts studio that Phillips opened in Bangkok. Ultimately, Phillips paid for Ong to attend school and Ong began living with Phillips at his residence in Bangkok.\n. According to Phillips\u2019s probation officer, Phillips was aware that the individual he knew as Dylan Thomas, whom he had met on the Internet through the BoyChat/BoyLover message board, and with whom he sought refuge when he fled Thailand, was engaging in sex with underage boys. Phillips claims that he was, however, unaware of Thomas's status as a fugitive convicted sex offender until Phillips returned to the United States from Mexico, was convicted of the underlying offense in this case and completed his term of incarceration. Then, in December, 2007, shortly after he was released from prison after serving his original 36 month sentence in this case, while serving his sentence of lifetime supervised release, Mr. Phillips learned that the individual whom he knew as Dylan Thomas was a fugitive convicted sex offender and attempted to broker a deal with FBI to disclose Mr. Thomas's (Schillaci\u2019s) whereabouts in exchange for a release from his supervised release. This Court's prior opinion and order, affirming the sentence imposed by the district court for Phillips\u2019s violation of the terms of his supervised release, contains a very detailed discussion of the specifics of Mr. Phillips\u2019s supervised release violations. See 370 Fed.Appx. at 613-16.\n. Whether an actual innocence claim is more appropriately construed as seeking equitable tolling or an equitable exception to the statutory bar was discussed in McQuiggin:\nPerkins, however, asserts not an excuse for filing after the statute of limitations has run. Instead, he maintains that a plea of actual innocence can overcome AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. He thus seeks an equitable exception to \u00a7 2244(d)(1), not an extension of the time statutorily prescribed.\n133 S.Ct. at 1931 (emphasis in original) (citing Rivas v. Fischer, 687 F.3d 514, 547 n. 42 (2d Cir.2012) (which noted that some courts have framed the actual innocence question as whether the AEDPA allows for \u201cequitable tolling\u201d but finding it more accurate to describe the issue as whether an \"equitable exception\u201d exists because the due diligence requirement for equitable tolling is \"incompatible with a workable actual innocence exception\u201d)).\n. The Court declines to accept the government\u2019s suggestion that in McQuiggin, the Court meant to limit actual innocence claims to those instances where a petitioner presents new facts, i.e. newly discovered evidence of innocence, and by implication to undermine those cases that have applied an equitable exception in cases where the innocence is occasioned not by new evidence but by an intervening, controlling change in the law as applied to a static set of facts. As discussed infra, numerous cases recognize an actual innocence or fundamental miscarriage of justice exception when applied in the context of a claim of legal or statutory actual innocence, albeit through varied analytical approaches.\n. In Wooten, this Court recognized that a federal prisoner unable to challenge the legality of his detention under \u00a7 2255 \"may also challenge the legality of his detention under \u00a7 2241 if he falls within the 'savings clause\u2019 of \u00a7 2255....\u201d 677 F.3d at 306-07. Section 2255\u2019s savings clause states:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). See also Martin v. Perez, 319 F.3d 799, 803-04 (6th Cir.2003) (recognizing that \u00a7 2255 \"was not intended to supplant\u201d \u00a7 2241 and permitting petitioner to assert a Bousley actual innocence claim under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255); United States v. Peterman, 249 F.3d 458, 461-62 (6th Cir.2001) (recognizing that a petitioner may utilize \u00a7 2241 \u201cvia \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause,\u201d to assert a claim of actual innocence based upon intervening Supreme Court precedent that establishes that he was actually innocent). Whether analyzed as an equitable exception to an untimely or procedurally defaulted \u00a7 2255 claim or as a \u00a7 2241 claim via \u00a7 225 5's savings clause, the actual innocence exception asks the same fundamental question: does the petitioner stand convicted of conduct that the law does not make criminal, either because of credible evidentiary proof that he did not commit the crime or because the law has rendered his conduct not criminal.\n. In this regard we must distinguish Logan v. United States, 434 F.3d 503, 508 (6th Cir.2006), where we concluded that unique similarities between the federal carjacking and arson statutes, along with the government\u2019s concession in that case that the two statutes would be similarly interpreted, led us to permit the petitioner to rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the carjacking statute in asserting his actual innocence claim under the arson statute. Such is not the case here, and the government makes no such concession, vigorously disputing the claim of similarities between \u00a7 2250(a) of SORNA and \u00a7 2423(c) of the PROTECT Act, and strongly contesting the precedential value of Carr in the context of this case.",
