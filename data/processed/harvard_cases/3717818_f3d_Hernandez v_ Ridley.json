        "text": "O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.\nJose Hernandez, Jr., and Salvador Hernandez were killed by a motorist while they were performing road construction in Oklahoma. Their representative sued their employer, Duit Construction Company, and the motorist and alleged a substantive due process claim against a host of Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) employees. All ODOT employees except the director and the resident engineer on the construction project were dismissed by the district court. The question is whether the two remaining employees are entitled to qualified immunity. The district judge said no. But, because the alleged facts reveal no constitutional violation, we must reverse.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe case was decided on a motion to dismiss so we take the facts from the second amended complaint. Wilson v. Montano, 715 F.3d 847, 852 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 426, 187 L.Ed.2d 282, 2013 WL 3994417 (Oct. 15, 2013). Duit Construction Company was hired by ODOT to serve as the general contractor on a road construction project on Interstate 40 near Yukon, Oklahoma. The Hernandezes \u2014 Jose, Jose Jr., and Salvador \u2014 worked for Duit. At the time of the accident, Gary Ridley was director of ODOT and Taylor Henderson, an ODOT employee, was the resident engineer overseeing the project. In that capacity, Henderson had \u201cultimate authority\u201d over the project with respect to implementation of traffic control devices, lane closures and speed reductions, as well as authority to suspend the project if conditions were unsafe for workers. (Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x at 25.)\nThe contract between ODOT and Duit imposed penalties on Duit if it failed to complete the project on time. Another part of the contract required ODOT\u2019s approval of traffic control devices used during the project including the erection of barrier walls \u2014 concrete barriers placed between the construction project and oncoming traffic. It also called for a nighttime lane closure beginning at 7 P.M. Duit could obtain additional lane closures by paying a \u201c \u2018lane rental fee\u2019 often at the cost of $30,000 an hour.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x at 27.) ODOT could waive the fee if doing so would benefit Oklahoma citizens.\nPrior to the accident, Duit made multiple requests to ODOT to allow additional lane closures to ensure the safety of its workers. One of those requests, made twenty days before the accident, sought a daytime lane closure for thirty days. Henderson denied all requests. Duit also requested the speed limit in the construction area be reduced to 50 mph. That request was also denied.\nOn June 30, 2010, Duit required the Hernandezes to begin work on the project at 5 P.M. even though the lane where they would be working was not scheduled to be closed with concrete barriers until 7 P.M. While they were working, distracted motorist Ethel Cooper drove off the roadway, running over and killing Jose Jr. and Salvador. After the accident, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration conducted an investigation which included interviews of Duit employees. The employees said ODOT was their \u201cbiggest enemy\u201d with respect to construction safety. (Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x at 26.)\nJose (hereinafter Hernandez) was appointed personal representative of the estates of Jose Jr. and Salvador. He brought suit against Duit, Cooper, and several ODOT employees. The ODOT employees moved to dismiss the complaint based on qualified immunity and failure to state a claim. The district judge concluded the ODOT employees, with the exception of Ridley and Henderson, were enti-tied to dismissal because the complaint did not contain specific factual allegations against them; instead the complaint referred generically to \u201cODOT employees.\u201d As to Ridley and Henderson, however, the judge decided the complaint stated a plausible substantive due process violation and neither was entitled to qualified immunity.\nII. DISCUSSION\n\u201cAlthough an order denying a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is not a final judgment, this court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the order \u2018to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.\u2019 \u201d Wilson, 715 F.3d at 852 (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)). Our review of a rejected motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is de novo. Id. In conducting our review, we \u201caccept[] as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint and view[ ] the allegations in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d Id.\n\u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials \u2018from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). To resolve qualified immunity claims at the motion to dismiss stage, a court must consider two elements: whether the facts alleged establish a constitutional violation and whether the violation was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the alleged misconduct. Id. at 232, 129 S.Ct. 808. A plaintiff \u201cmust allege sufficient facts that show \u2014 when taken as true \u2014 the defendant plausibly violated his constitutional rights, which were clearly established at the time of violation.\u201d Schwartz v. Booker, 702 F.3d 573, 579 (10th Cir.2012).\nRidley and Henderson argue Hernandez has failed to (1) allege sufficient facts showing they plausibly violated Jose Jr. and Salvador\u2019s substantive due process rights, and (2) show those rights were clearly established at the time of the violation. Because we agree on the first point, we need not decide the second.\nThe Fourt\u00e9enth Amendment prohibits a State from depriving \u201cany person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. This provision guarantees \u201cmore than fair process\u201d; it also covers a \u201csubstantive sphere ..., barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 840, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (quotations omitted).\nNormally, \u201cstate actors are liable only for their own acts, and not the violent acts of third parties.\u201d Armijo v. Wagon Mound Pub. Schs., 159 F.3d 1253, 1260 (10th Cir.1998). Thus, \u201ca State\u2019s failure to protect an individual against private violence ... does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\u201d DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). \u201cThere are, however, two recognized exceptions to this rule. First, state officials may be liable for the acts of private parties when the state has assumed a special relationship with and control over an individual. Second, state officials can be liable for the acts of private parties where those officials created the very danger that caused the harm.\u201d Estate of B.I.C. v. Gillen, 710 F.3d 1168, 1173 (10th Cir.2013) (citation omitted). Hernandez argues the second exception \u2014 the danger-creation exception \u2014 applies here.\nTo invoke the danger-creation exception, a plaintiff must establish as a threshold matter (1) private violence, and (2) affirmative conduct on the part of the state in placing the plaintiff in danger. Gray v. Univ. of Colo. Hosp. Auth., 672 F.3d 909, 920 & n. 8 (10th Cir.2012); see also Estate of B.I.C., 710 F.3d at 1173. He must also satisfy all elements of a six-part test:\n(1) [defendant] created the danger or increased plaintiffs vulnerability to the danger in some way; (2) plaintiff was a member of a limited and specifically definable group; (3) defendant\u2019s conduct put plaintiff at substantial risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm; (4) the risk was obvious or known; (5) defendants acted recklessly in conscious disregard of that risk; and (6) such conduct, when viewed in total, is conscience shocking.\nChristiansen v. City of Tulsa, 332 F.3d 1270, 1281 (10th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted). Hernandez\u2019s complaint not only fails to satisfy either threshold element but also fails to adequately allege several elements of the six-part test.\nA. Private Violence\nThe danger-creation exception requires a private act of violence to have caused the victim\u2019s harm. Gray, 672 F.3d at 928. Violence requires \u201c[a]t the very least\u201d some degree of deliberateness on the part of the private actor; negligence is insufficient. Id. at 928-29. Thus, no constitutional violation occurs when a private party\u2019s underlying negligent act is directly responsible for the victim\u2019s harm. Id. at 929-30. Here, Hernandez alleges Jose Jr. and Salvador were killed by Cooper\u2019s negligent driving, not by an act of violence. Thus, he has not satisfied the private violence requirement.\nB. Affirmative Conduct Creating the Danger and Placing Jose Jr. and Salvador at Substantial Risk of Serious, Immediate, and Proximate Harm\nThe affirmative conduct requirement typically involves conduct imposing \u201can immediate threat of harm, which by its nature has a limited range and duration,\u201d and is \u201cdirected at a discrete plaintiff rather than the public at large.\u201d Ruiz v. McDonnell, 299 F.3d 1173, 1183 (10th Cir.2002). Inaction by the state is insufficient. Estate of B.I.C., 710 F.3d at 1173. Moreover, under the first and third elements of the six-part test described above, the affirmative conduct must have created the danger to the plaintiff and have put the plaintiff at substantial risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm. Christiansen, 332 F.3d at 1281.\nHernandez alleges Henderson, as resident engineer, had ultimate authority over the project with respect to implementation of any traffic control devices, lane closures or speed reductions, as well as the authority to suspend the project if conditions were unsafe for workers. He claims Henderson knew Duit was behind on the project and thus subject to possible delay penalties, based on Duit\u2019s repeated requests for lane closures and speed reductions. Thus, he says Henderson also knew Duit had a financial incentive to require its employees to work without traffic control measures in place. Nevertheless \u2014 and despite the obvious risk faced by Jose Jr. and Salvador if forced to work without such traffic control measures \u2014 Henderson repeatedly refused Duit\u2019s requests for lane closures and speed reductions, refused to waive the steep lane rental fees called for in the contract, and failed to suspend the project.\nHernandez alleges Ridley, as Director of ODOT, is responsible for adequately training ODOT employees and establishing standard safety procedures to protect construction personnel working on Oklahoma roads. Despite these responsibilities, Hernandez claims Ridley failed to implement any guidelines, policies, regulations or procedures for the protection of highway construction personnel. This lack of guidelines and procedures, according to Hernandez, led to Henderson creating the dangerous conditions causing the deaths of Jose Jr. and Salvador. He further claims Ridley\u2019s policies of imposing financial penalties for failure to timely complete construction projects and charging costly lane rental fees in order to close lanes outside the time period provided by the contract created a financial incentive for Duit to expose its workers to unsafe conditions.\nRidley\u2019s alleged failure to promulgate safety standards governing road construction in Oklahoma is not affirmative conduct but rather inaction, which is insufficient. His adoption of general project-management policies (i.e., requiring penalties for falling behind schedule and imposing expensive lane rental fees) also fails to satisfy the affirmative conduct or causation requirements. See Gray, 672 F.3d at 926-27. At the time he adopted these policies, Jose Jr. and Salvador were not \u201cidentifiable victim[s].\u201d Id. at 926. Thus, the policies were not aimed at them directly and \u201cdid not pose a threat of immediate and proximate harm\u201d to them; \u201c[leather they presented a threat of an indefinite range and duration\u201d to a \u201cbroader populace.\u201d See id. at 926-27 (defendant\u2019s policy of assuring patients of 24-hour monitoring but allowing its staff to leave such patients unattended did not constitute affirmative conduct or establish the necessary causation because it was not aimed at plaintiff directly and did not pose a threat of immediate harm to him); see also Ruiz, 299 F.3d at 1183 (mere state licensure of daycare facility where child was shaken to death does not constitute affirmative conduct placing child in danger because licen-sure (1) did not impose an immediate threat of harm but rather a threat of an indefinite range and duration and (2) was not aimed at the child or his mother directly but rather the public at large).\nHenderson\u2019s alleged conduct is a marginally closer question. On the one hand, Henderson failed to act \u2014 he denied Duit\u2019s requests for lane closures and speed reductions, failed to grant a waiver of the \u201clane rental fees,\u201d and failed to suspend the project. On the other hand, Henderson took these actions in response to specific requests from Duit. Thus, his conduct is not mere inaction but can be viewed as affirmative conduct. Nevertheless, a more glaring problem exists \u2014 Hernandez\u2019s failure to allege facts demonstrating it was Ridley and Henderson, as opposed to Duit, whose conduct created the danger putting Jose Jr. and Salvador at substantial risk of serious, immediate, and proximate harm.\nAccording to the complaint, Duit required Jose Jr. and Salvador to work on the project prior to the scheduled lane closure because Duit was behind on the project and thus faced a penalty under the contract. Hernandez does not claim either Henderson or Ridley knew Duit required its employees to work in exposed areas before the scheduled lane closure. While one could infer Henderson\u2019s knowledge of Duit\u2019s delay predicament (based on his receiving Duit\u2019s requests for lane closures) and therefore suppose Duit might try to make up time by exposing its employees to danger, the fact remains it was Duit, not Ridley or Henderson, which chose to endanger Jose Jr. and Salvador for pecuniary gain \u2014 to avoid potential contractual penalties. Presumably Duit had other options available; it could have paid the fees for the requested land closures or paid the delay penalties to name but two. Ridley and Henderson\u2019s adherence to the performance standards contained in the contract did not force Duit to act recklessly.\nC. Shocks the Conscience\nHernandez argues Ridley and Henderson\u2019s acts and omissions in this case \u2014 which put monetary concerns and the desire to complete the project as quickly as possible before the health and safety of Jose Jr. and Salvador \u2014 are \u201ctruly conscience shocking.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Op. Br. at 11.) Hyperbole!\n\u201cThe ultimate standard for determining whether there has been a substantive due process violation is whether the challenged government action shocks the conscience of federal judges.\u201d Moore v. Guthrie, 438 F.3d 1036, 1040 (10th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). \u201cConduct that shocks the judicial conscience ... is deliberate government action that is arbitrary and unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice.\u201d Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City, 528 F.3d 762, 767 (10th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). To show a defendant\u2019s conduct is conscience shocking, a plaintiff must prove a government actor arbitrarily abused his authority or \u201cemploy[ed] it as an instrument of oppression.\u201d Williams v. Berney, 519 F.3d 1216, 1220 (10th Cir.2008). The behavior complained of must be egregious and outrageous. Id. (substantive due process prohibits \u201conly the most egregious official conduct\u201d) (quotations omitted); see also Uhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567, 574 (10th Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate a degree of out-rageousness and a magnitude of potential or actual harm that is truly conscience shocking.\u201d).\nThe most that can be said of Ridley and Henderson\u2019s conduct is that they held Duit to its contract with ODOT. We do not find this egregious or outrageous. Indeed, Ridley and Henderson\u2019s conduct in requiring Duit to perform its duties during the nighttime hours, when traffic is less and conditions are presumably safer \u2014 both for the traveling public and road construction workers \u2014 is a far cry from conscience-shocking.\nMoreover, as we attempt to discern whether alleged conduct is conscience-shocking, we are mindful that \u201cthe Due Process Clause \u2018is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised government decisions.\u2019\u201d Uhlrig, 64 F.3d at 573 (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights Tex., 503 U.S. 115, 129, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992)). Indeed, when applying this standard, we \u201cbear in mind three basic principles highlighted by the Supreme Court in evaluating substantive due process claims: (1) the need for restraint in defining their scope; (2) the concern that \u00a7 1983 not replace state tort law; and (3) the need for deference to local policymak-ing bodies in making decisions impacting upon public safety.\u201d Uhlrig, 64 F.3d at 573 (citations omitted).\nThe last consideration counsels against extending a substantive due process remedy in this case. By seeking to impose liability on Ridley and Henderson, Hernandez is asking us to be the \u201cMonday morning quarterback\u201d with respect to requiring Duit to perform according to the contract. It is beyond our charge to second-guess \u201ca rational decision making process that takes account of competing social, political, and economic forces.\u201d Moore, 438 F.3d at 1041. Here, those forces are nearly palpable. At a minimum, consideration must be given to safety of the public and construction crews, project costs, inconvenience to the travelling public, and the need to assure adequate traffic flow during construction. We focus particularly on the last consideration, adequate traffic flow during construction, because it so dramatically illustrates the need for judicial restraint. The increased dangers of night driving are generally known, as are the increased risks presented as traffic volumes increase, particularly in confined areas. But actually balancing the relative risks and benefits is a challenging task, going well beyond what is generally known or assumed, particularly when even more considerations are in play. A critic\u2019s post hoc analysis is no substitute for real time rational decisions.\nFinally, according to Hernandez, the time Ridley and Henderson had to reflect on their decisions makes their conduct conscience-shocking. While length of deliberation is a factor in a conscience-shocking analysis, see, e.g., Lewis, 523 U.S. at 853, 118 S.Ct. 1708; Radecki v. Barela, 146 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir.1998), \u201cit cannot replace the over-arching need for deference to local policy-making bodies.\u201d Moore, 438 F.3d at 1041 n. 1. \u201cWere this not so and any long-deliberated decision (resulting in a later injury) were called conscience-shocking, substantive due process violations would become a substantial and unnecessary substitute to state tort law.\u201d Id.\nREVERSED.\n. The contract is not included in the record on appeal. The second amended complaint contains references to it, which we accept as accurate.\n. Apparently the contract required the lanes to be open during the day. At oral argument, the parties clarified the lane closure called for under the contract was from 7 P.M. to 7 A.M.\n. The complaint does not indicate whether the closure requests were accompanied by a request for a fee waiver.\n. The normal speed limit is not contained in the record but it appears to be between 60 and 70 mph. See http://www.okhighways.com/ okcfi40.html. In his opening brief, Hernandez says it is 60 mph.\n. Hernandez's complaint alleges supervisory liability against Ridley based on his supervisory authority over Henderson. As we explain, the facts alleged in the second amended complaint, taken as true, do not amount to a substantive due process violation by Henderson. Thus, Hernandez cannot establish a constitutional claim against Ridley. See Gray v. Univ. of Colo. Hosp. Auth., 672 F.3d 909, 920 n. 7 (10th Cir.2012) (collecting cases). In any event, because the claim is easily disposed of, we analyze the allegations against Ridley. See Dodds v. Richardson, 614 F.3d 1185, 1199 (10th Cir.2010) (\"A plaintiff may ... succeed in a \u00a7 1983 suit against a defendant-supervisor by demonstrating: (1) the defendant promulgated, created, implemented or possessed responsibility for the continued operation of a policy that (2) caused the complained of constitutional harm, and (3) acted with the state of mind required to establish the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d).\n. Although Ridley and Henderson were not Jose Jr. and Salvador's direct employers, Hernandez's allegations are akin to claims made against government employers alleging a right to work in a reasonably safe environment. But the Supreme Court has declined to extend substantive due process protection to safe working conditions. See Collins v. City of Harker Heights Tex., 503 U.S. 115, 126, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (\"Neither the text nor the history of the Due Process Clause supports petitioner\u2019s claim that the governmental employer's duty to provide its employees with a safe working environment is a substantive component of the Due Process Clause.\u201d).",
