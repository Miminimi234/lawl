        "text": "McLAUGHLIN, Circuit Judge:\nTruck Drivers Local Union No. 807 (\u201cLocal 807\u201d or \u201cUnion\u201d) seeks to arbitrate certain alleged breaches of contract by three related corporations: Regional Import & Export Trucking, Regional Distribution & Warehousing Service (collectively \u201cRegional\u201d), and Regional\u2019s alleged alter ego, Newport Transportation Co. (\u201cNewport\u201d). Were this our only concern, the inquiry would be rather simple. Our task is complicated, however, because the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) has recently issued a ruling in this case, based on the same nucleus of facts, holding that the actions of Regional, Newport, and Local 807 constituted unfair labor practices in violation of Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cAct\u201d). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. With the statutory issues decided by the NLRB closely intertwined with the contractual issues in the present controversy, we proceed gingerly.\nLocal 807 brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, to compel Regional and Newport to arbitrate certain contractual grievances arising under the collective bargaining agreement between Local 807 and Regional (\u201cRegional Agreement\u201d). Local 807 promptly moved for summary judgment, which Regional opposed on the ground that the Board\u2019s decision precluded arbitration. Co-defendant Newport cross-moved for summary judgment on the ground that, because it was not a party to the Regional Agreement, it could not be bound by the arbitration clause of the Regional Agreement. In opposing Newport\u2019s cross-motion, Local 807 took the position that material issues of fact existed as to whether Newport could be bound by the Regional Agreement.\nWhile these motions were pending, a related charge of unfair labor practices on the part of Regional and Newport and a charge against the Union for breach of its duty of fair representation were proceeding apace before the NLRB. The Board sustained the charges against Regional, Newport, and the Union, and also refused to defer the unfair representation claim pending arbitration because it found an intrinsic conflict of interest on the part of the Union. The Board\u2019s ruling was eventually enforced by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Because the NLRB held that deferral to arbitration was inappropriate, the district court in the present proceeding determined that the Union was collaterally estopped from demanding arbitration. The district court, accordingly, denied Local 807\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Newport\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. This appeal ensued.\nBACKGROUND\nRegional is in the trucking industry. This includes pick-up and transportation of freight from piers in the New York metropolitan region, as well as warehousing and distribution. Regional Import & Export opened for business in 1965, performing the pick-up and transportation services; Regional Distribution & Warehousing, a separately incorporated entity, began providing warehousing and distribution services to customers in 1974. All of these operations were consolidated in 1978, although the corporations maintained their distinct corporate identities.\nLocal 807 is the exclusive bargaining representative of Regional\u2019s truck drivers, platform men, checkers, warehousemen, and hi-lo operators. After the 1978 consolidation of operations, employees from Regional Distribution & Warehousing became disgruntled by what they viewed as inequities between their own pay rates and those of the employees of Regional Import & Export. In 1985, as the Local 807/Regional Import & Export collective bargaining agreement was due to expire, the Union began negotiating a single renewal contract to cover all of Regional\u2019s bargaining-unit employees and, in the process, to eliminate the alleged pay inequities. Negotiations were heated, with Regional steadfastly opposing any significant wage increases. Eventually, Regional grudgingly agreed to an across-the-board wage increase of fifty cents per hour and to several additional provisions designed to resolve the disparity between the terms and conditions of employment of the two groups of Regional employees.\nRegional and Local 807 memorialized this contract in a memorandum, which contained eight substantive provisions, and specifically incorporated all the terms and conditions of employment contained in the 1982 collective bargaining agreement between Local 807 and Regional Import & Export. One of the incorporated terms was the arbitration clause, providing for arbitration of \u201cany controversy which might arise\u201d between the parties.\nShortly thereafter, Andrew Ferrara entered the picture. Ferrara was Regional\u2019s overseer of operations, and he asked Patrick Nastro, Regional\u2019s president, to turn over several Regional accounts to him, which he would then personally manage through an independent business entity. Nastro eventually agreed. Ferrara then proceeded to incorporate a new company\u2014 defendant Newport \u2014 which, like Regional, would provide various services in the trucking industry.\nPursuant to the understanding between Nastro and Ferrara, Newport entered into several agreements with Regional which provided for the lease and/or transfer of certain Regional vehicles and equipment to Newport. Regional also transferred a number of its accounts to Newport. Additionally, a significant portion of Regional\u2019s managerial staff moved over to Newport\u2019s payroll. In turn, Regional began to trim its staff, necessitating the layoff of approximately twenty-seven employees. Thus, while Regional remained a going concern, its operations, management, and equipment were significantly streamlined by the agreements with Newport.\nOnce Newport commenced operations, Local 807 demanded to be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of Newport\u2019s employees. Newport eventually granted recognition to Local 807, and the two entered into a collective bargaining agreement (the \u201cNewport Agreement\u201d).\nFernando Sanches, who used to work for Regional, filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB, alleging that he had been laid off because of the unlawful creation of Newport by Regional. He charged that Newport was a sham, that it was actually the alter ego of Regional and had been created solely to avoid Regional\u2019s obligations under the 1985 collective bargaining agreement. Sanches also filed a grievance with his union, Local 807, alleging that the sham transaction was a breach of the Regional Agreement. Local 807, which it will be recalled now represented the employees of both Regional and Newport, failed to accept and process Sanches\u2019 grievance, so Sanches filed another unfair labor practice charge against Local 807 for breach of its duty of fair representation. The NLRB thereafter issued an amended consolidated complaint, charging the corporations (Regional and Newport) with violating Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) & (3), and charging the Union (Local 807) with violating Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act.\nReacting to the NLRB complaint, Local 807 filed a demand for arbitration of Sanch-es\u2019 grievance against Regional; and Regional and Local 807 initially agreed to arbitrate, provided the grievance was \u201cotherwise arbitrable.\u201d Regional and Local 807, in their respective answers to the NLRB unfair labor practice charges, then interposed the affirmative defense that all issues were subject to binding arbitration, and, therefore, the NLRB should defer to arbitration. As the NLRB proceeding progressed, however, Regional withdrew this affirmative defense because it believed that Local 807, representing, as it did, the employees of both Regional and Newport, had an inherent conflict of interest that made deferral to arbitration improper. The Union, however, continued to maintain that there was no conflict and that the NLRB proceedings should be deferred pending the outcome of arbitration.\nBecause Regional now refused to go to arbitration, Local 807 commenced the present action in the Eastern District of New York, seeking to compel Regional and Newport to arbitrate pursuant to the Regional Agreement. Local 807 then moved for summary judgment against Regional to compel arbitration. In opposing this motion, Regional argued that the AU assigned to the NLRB proceeding would be deciding whether deferral to arbitration was proper. Newport also cross-moved for summary judgment on the ground that, because it was neither a party to the Regional Agreement nor a successor or alter ego of Regional, it could not be bound by the provisions of the Regional Agreement.\nBefore the district court could rule on these motions, the AU issued a voluminous decision on the unfair labor practice charges. The AU determined that all three respondents (Regional, Newport, and Local 807) had committed unfair labor practices. Specifically, he held that Regional had violated Section 8(a)(3) of the Act by creating Newport and thereafter laying off bargaining-unit employees; that Newport was the alter ego of Regional, and had also violated the Act; and that Local 807 had violated Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act by refusing to accept and process the grievance filed by Sanches, a bargaining-unit employee of Regional. The AU concluded that Regional, Newport, and Local 807 were jointly liable for remedying these unfair labor practices.\nSquarely addressing the deferral issue, the AU stated that deferral to arbitration was inappropriate for several reasons, including the fact that Local 807 faced a conflict \u201cin representing the Newport employees at the same time it [sought] to replace them with the Regional unit workers.\u201d AU\u2019s Decision at 49. The AU continued that \u201c[a] further aspect of this conflict is [Local 807\u2019s] alignment with ... Newport against [the interests] of the Regional work force arising from its active role in seeking a contract with Newport at a time when it owed an exclusive duty to the Regional unit members in preserving their jobs.... \u201d Id.\nAll three respondents appealed to the NLRB, which affirmed the AU in all respects relevant to this appeal. Regional and Newport then announced that they would comply with the Board\u2019s ruling. Local 807, however, petitioned the Third Circuit to reverse the Board. The Third Circuit enforced the Board\u2019s order in an unpublished decision.\nThe district court now had to consider the pending motions for summary judgment in a radically changed landscape, i.e., the Board\u2019s enforced order. Judge Spatt held that he had jurisdiction to entertain these claimed contractual breaches, notwithstanding the Board\u2019s decision on the statutory issues. He then determined that Local 807 was collaterally estopped from compelling arbitration because of the Board\u2019s finding that deferral to arbitration was inappropriate. Judge Spatt therefore denied Local 807\u2019s motion. Turning to Newport\u2019s cross-motion, Judge Spatt concluded that issues of fact existed as to whether Newport was the alter ego of Regional. However, in light of his decision that he was barred from compelling arbitration because of the now-affirmed NLRB ruling, he granted Newport\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the Union\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.\nThis appeal followed.\nDISCUSSION\nThe precepts governing our review of a motion to compel arbitration are now firmly established. In AT & T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, 475 U.S. 643, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986), the Supreme Court distilled the relevant considerations and enunciated four intersecting principles to guide our inquiry. The first is that \u201c \u2018arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 648, 106 S.Ct. at 1418 (quoting United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1353, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960)); see Transit Mix Concrete Corp. v. Local Union No. 282, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 809 F.2d 963, 967 (2d Cir.1987).\nThe second is that the question of arbitrability \u2014 i.e., whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular dispute to arbitration \u2014 \u201cis undeniably an issue for judicial determination.\u201d AT & T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 649, 106 S.Ct. at 1418; see Transit Mix Concrete, 809 F.2d at 967. This principle \u201cfollows inexorably from the first\u201d because a duty to arbitrate a particular grievance can stem only from a contractual agreement to arbitrate, and a determination of the scope of such a contractual term is peculiarly within the purview of the judiciary. See John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 547, 84 S.Ct. 909, 913, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964) (\u201c[t]he duty to arbitrate being of contractual origin, a compulsory submission to arbitration cannot precede judicial determination that the collective bargaining agreement does in fact create such a duty\u201d).\nThe third principle is that courts should not stray into the merits of the underlying grievance. See AT & T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 649-50, 106 S.Ct. at 1418-19; Transit Mix Concrete, 809 F.2d at 967-68. \u201c[E]ven if it appears to the court to be frivolous, the union\u2019s claim that the employer has violated the collective-bargaining agreement is to be decided, not by the court asked to order arbitration, but as the parties have agreed, by the arbitrator.\u201d AT & T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 649-50, 106 S.Ct. at 1419; see Emery Air Freight Corp. v. Local Union 295, 786 F.2d 93, 96 (2d Cir.1986).\nFinally, where the collective bargaining agreement contains an arbitration clause, there is a \u201cpresumption of arbitrability.\u201d AT & T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 650, 106 S.Ct. at 1419. In other words, \u201c \u2018[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Warrior & Gulf Navigation, 363 U.S. at 582-83, 80 S.Ct. at 1353). This \u201cpresumption of arbitrability\u201d flows from the national labor policy favoring arbitration in labor disputes because it promotes labor peace and avoids the more volatile remedies of strikes and lock-outs. See Schneider Moving & Storage Co. v. Robbins, 466 U.S. 364, 371-72, 104 S.Ct. 1844, 1848-49, 80 L.Ed.2d 366 (1984); Warrior & Gulf Navigation, 363 U.S. at 577-78, 80 S.Ct. at 1350. As such, \u201c[w]e will order arbitration if the arbitration clause is broad and if the party seeking arbitration has made a claim that on its face is governed by the contract, even if the claim appears to be frivolous.\u201d Associated Brick Mason Contractors, Inc. v. Harrington, 820 F.2d 31, 35 (2d Cir.1987).\nThere can be no argument that the Regional Agreement contains a broad arbitration clause, binding on both Local 807 and Regional. Specifically, the Regional Agreement provides for arbitration of \u201cany controversy which might arise\u201d between the parties. We are hard-pressed to think of a more sweeping arbitration clause. Clearly, the contract contemplates that disputes over layoffs caused by purported work transfers are to be arbitrated.\nRegional maintains, however, that notwithstanding the sweep of the arbitration clause, Local 807\u2019s claims are not arbitra-ble. Regional argues that Judge Spatt properly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to the Board\u2019s finding that Local 807\u2019s conflict of interest precluded deferral to arbitration, and that a decision by the Board not to defer to arbitration because of a conflict of interest actually precludes arbitration. We disagree.\nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel may, of course, apply to the relitigation in a court of prior findings by the Board. See United States v. Utah Constr. & Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 422, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 1560, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966); Woodlawn Cemetery v. Local 365, Cemetery Workers, 930 F.2d 154, 156 n. 2 (2d Cir.1991). A court, however, should not be too quick to conclude that the Board has finally resolved an issue thereby insulating it from relitigation. Thus, on a motion to compel arbitration, collateral estoppel will extend only to those issues that the Board has decided impose insuperable barriers to arbitration. See Hudson-Berlind Corp. v. Local 807, 591 F.Supp. 1282, 1286-87 (E.D.N.Y.1984) (Board\u2019s determination that there was no employer/employee relationship at time grievance arose was entitled to collateralestoppel effect and precluded arbitration of the grievance). We must therefore consider whether the Board\u2019s refusal to defer to arbitration is a valid ground for precluding arbitration. If it is not, we must then determine whether the Board\u2019s finding of a conflict of interest would itself serve to preclude arbitration.\nIs the Board\u2019s refusal to defer to arbitration the equivalent of an order that arbitration not go forward? We think not. An understanding of the Board\u2019s deferral policy is necessary. In certain circumstances, the Board will refrain from exercising its exclusive jurisdiction to determine unfair labor practices because those grievances may be resolved more expeditiously in an arbitral proceeding. See United Technologies Corp., 268 N.L.R.B. 557 (1984) (citing Collyer Insulated Wire, 192 N.L.R.B. 837 (1971)). The Board has broad discretion to stay its hand and defer to the dispute resolution procedures established by the parties in their collective bargaining agreement. Carey v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 375 U.S. 261, 264-66, 84 S.Ct. 401, 405-06, 11 L.Ed.2d 320 (1964). In cases such as this one, the Board\u2019s policy is to defer when, inter alia, (1) all the issues in the unfair labor practice proceeding are suitable for resolution by arbitration, (2) the employer has agreed to pursue arbitration, and (3) the interests of the union are not contrary to those of the affected employees. See United Technologies, 268 N.L.R.B. at 558-60; General American Transportation, 228 N.L.R.B. 808, 817 (1977) (Members Penello and Walther, dissenting). Generally, if any one of these three conditions is absent from a particular case, the Board will not defer.\nHere the Board refused to defer to arbitration for several stated reasons: the Union\u2019s conflict of interest, Regional had not agreed to arbitrate, and not all the unfair labor practice issues would be resolved in an arbitral proceeding. The district court extrapolated from all this that the Board\u2019s decision not to defer to arbitration was the equivalent of a finding that the grievances were not arbitrable as a matter of law. We find this conclusion unwarranted.\nCollateral estoppel precludes arbitration only if the previously-decided issue would, in and of itself, be a valid reason to preclude arbitration. See Hudson-Berlind Corp., 597 F.Supp. at 1286-87. The Board\u2019s decision that it would not defer to arbitration is not \u2014 and was never intended to be \u2014 a final determination by the Board that the controversy was not arbitrable as a matter of law. As stated, the Board may refuse to defer for numerous reasons, many of them based on Board policy. Such policy-rooted determinations do not necessarily bar arbitration as a matter of law.\nIf the Board's discretionary refusal to defer to arbitration had the collateral effect of precluding arbitration, the Board would assume control over the parties\u2019 right to pursue their contractual remedies. Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, however, provides the courts with jurisdiction to resolve contractual claims that happen also to be the subject of unfair labor practice charges. See Carey, 375 U.S. at 271-72, 84 S.Ct. at 408-09; Smith v. Evening News Ass\u2019n, 371 U.S. 195, 197-98, 83 S.Ct. 267, 268-69, 9 L.Ed.2d 246 (1962). Thus, the Board\u2019s exercise of its jurisdiction does not prevent courts from exercising their jurisdiction.\nDefendants argue that the district court was bound at least by the reasons the Board gave for refusing to defer to arbitration. They contend, therefore, that arbitration is barred by the Board\u2019s finding that Local 807 had a conflict of interest. While the district court seems to have agreed with this argument, we are not persuaded by it. The Board referred to the conflict of interest as being \u201cgermane to [Local 807\u2019s] capacity to fairly represent the grievants.\u201d ALJ\u2019s Decision at 50. The \u201capparent conflict\u201d between the interests of the Regional and Newport employees, which were both represented by Local 807, was merely one reason why the Board refused to defer to arbitration. The Board never concluded that this \u201capparent conflict\u201d, in and of itself, precluded arbitration.\nMore importantly, the present circumstances differ from those that existed when the matter was before the Board, and do not indicate that Local 807 will be unable to represent fairly the apparently conflicting interests of the Regional and Newport employees. The conflict of interest presented to the Board involved allegations that Local 807 had aligned itself with Newport against the Regional employees. Presently, however, Local 807 seeks from the arbitrators an award of backpay for both the Regional and Newport employees; it does not seek to replace the Newport employees with Regional employees. All of the displaced Regional employees have been reinstated. Additionally, even assuming the taint of some conflict, the parties have agreed to establish a procedure at the arbitration proceeding that will allow Sanches\u2019 attorney to participate fully; and, we have full faith in the ability of the arbitrators to avoid any conflict. Thus, there is no persuasive claim that the employees\u2019 interests will not be fully protected.\nWe are aware that under certain circumstances, a determination that a union has breached its duty of fair representation may allow an employee either to bypass the arbitration process completely or to have any resulting arbitration award vacated. For instance, in Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967), the Supreme Court held that a union\u2019s failure to process an employee\u2019s grievances allowed the employee to bypass the contractually-mandated arbitration provision and immediately file a Section 301 suit in the district court. Id. at 186, 87 S.Ct. at 914. In Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976), the Court expanded on Vaca and held that where an arbitration award against the employee results from the union\u2019s inexcusable failure to discover and present evidence \u2014 evidence that clearly would have resulted in a contrary award\u2014 the arbitration award may be vacated and the employee may pursue his contractual claims in the district court. Id. at 568-71, 96 S.Ct. at 1058-59.\nWe do not read these cases to bar arbitration of an employee\u2019s contractual claims every time the union, by failing to process employee grievances, has breached its duty of fair representation. In a case such as this one, Vaca teaches that the employees would have the option to bypass the arbitration procedure and look to the court to enforce their contractual rights, were they to so choose. Vaca, 386 U.S. at 186, 87 S.Ct. at 914. The employees here have chosen to allow Local 807 to pursue their contractual rights via the arbitration procedure. They do not seek to circumvent the contractual grievance procedure because of Local 807\u2019s prior breach of its duty. Thus, there can be no claim that any resulting arbitration award will be invalid merely because of the Union\u2019s prior breach of its duty of fair representation.\nApplication of the Regional Agreement to Newport\nLocal 807 argues that if we conclude that the present grievances are arbitrable, this case should be remanded to the district court to determine whether Newport is the alter ego of Regional and thus bound by the arbitration clause of the Regional Agreement. Newport claims, however, that it never agreed to arbitrate under the Regional Agreement and, furthermore, that the Board\u2019s decision prohibits the application of the Regional Agreement to Newport because the decision implicitly holds that the employees of Regional and Newport are not a single bargaining unit. Newport argues that before it may be bound by the terms of a contract it did not sign, there must be a finding that Regional and Newport are a single employer and a finding that the employees of both Regional and Newport constitute a single bargaining unit. Newport claims that because the Board\u2019s holding precludes a finding of a single bargaining unit, Newport cannot be bound to the Regional Agreement. We are not persuaded for two reasons.\nFirst, we disagree with Newport\u2019s bald assertion that the Board\u2019s decision implicitly holds that the Newport and Regional employees are necessarily separate bargaining units. The Board held that neither Local 807 nor Newport committed an unfair labor practice by entering into a collective bargaining agreement even though Local 807 had not previously attained proper recognition as the exclusive bargaining agent of the Newport employees. It is clear to us that the Board\u2019s reasoning was based on its contemporaneous holding that Newport was the alter ego of Regional, rather than on some unarticulated 'assumption that the employees of Newport were a separate bargaining unit. Indeed, the Board had no reason to consider this single-unit question because there was no charge in the NLRB proceeding that the Newport employees had been discriminated against. Thus, contrary to Newport\u2019s contention, we believe the Board has not definitively asserted its jurisdiction to decide this single employer/single bargaining unit issue. See South Prairie Constr. Co. v. International Union of Operating Engineers, 425 U.S. 800, 804-806, 96 S.Ct. 1842, 1844-45, 48 L.Ed.2d 382 (1976) (per curiam) (court usurped authority of NLRB by deciding \u201csingle unit\u201d question where NLRB had asserted jurisdiction but never reached the question because of erroneous preliminary finding that employers were not a \u201csingle employer\u201d).\nSecond, and more importantly, Newport\u2019s suggestion that the Board has conclusively determined that the two groups of employees are not a single bargaining unit, thus precluding the application of the Regional Agreement to Newport, blithely ignores the Board\u2019s finding that Newport was the alter ego of Regional. The alter ego doctrine provides an analytical hook to bind a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement. See Southport Petroleum Co. v. NLRB, 315 U.S. 100, 106, 62 S.Ct. 452, 455, 86 L.Ed. 718 (1942); Goodman Piping Products, Inc. v. NLRB, 741 F.2d 10, 11-12 (2d Cir.1984) (per curiam). The alter ego doctrine, while having the same binding effect on a non-signatory as the single employer/single unit doctrine, is conceptually distinct. See Local One Amalgamated Lithographers v. Stearns & Beale, Inc., 812 F.2d 763, 772 (2d Cir.1987); Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., 690 F.2d 489, 507-508 (5th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 932, 104 S.Ct. 335, 78 L.Ed.2d 305 (1983). In Pratt-Famsworth, the Fifth Circuit stated that the focus of \u201cthe alter ego doctrine, unlike that of the single employer doctrine, is on the existence of a disguised continuance or an attempt to avoid the obligations of a collective bargaining agreement through a sham transaction or technical change in operations.\u201d Id. at 508. The hallmarks of the alter ego doctrine include \u201cwhether the two enterprises have substantially identical management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers, supervision, and ownership.\u201d Goodman Piping, 741 F.2d at 11.\nWe find nothing in the Board\u2019s decision that would preclude a determination that Newport is the alter ego of Regional and therefore bound by the arbitration clause of the Regional Agreement. In fact, Newport\u2019s argument approaches frivolity in light of the Board\u2019s specific finding that Newport is the alter ego of Regional. We note that the Board determined that \u201cfor the purposes of [the NLRB] proceeding,\u201d Newport was the alter ego of Regional. Because the district court erroneously concluded that the present claims were not arbitrable, it never had to resolve the alter ego issue.\nPotential Conflict with Board Remedy\nFinally, defendants maintain that arbitration is either improper because any remedy will necessarily conflict with the Board\u2019s remedial order, or unnecessary because it will simply track the Board\u2019s order. We disagree. The Board\u2019s remedial order affords no relief to the Newport employees, who were forced to perform the transferred unit-work at lower rates of pay. More importantly, however, neither of these arguments persuades us because both necessarily lure us into the merits of the grievances. As previously stated, our task is to determine only whether the grievances are arbitrable, not whether they are meritorious. See AT & T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 649, 106 S.Ct. at 1419; Emery Air Freight, 786 F.2d at 96-97. The mere possibility that the eventual arbitration award may conflict with the Board\u2019s ruling is not a cognizable basis for refusing to compel arbitration. See Transit Mix Concrete, 809 F.2d at 969 n. 3.\nCONCLUSION\nWe find that the district court improperly held that the present grievances were not arbitrable. We remand for the district court to compel arbitration and to determine whether Newport is bound by the arbitration clause of the Regional Agreement.\nReversed and Remanded.\n. As previously stated, Local 807 did not move for summary judgment against Newport because it took the position that the district court first had to hold a hearing on whether Newport was bound by the Regional Agreement.\n. One of the other reasons for refusing to defer to arbitration was that arbitration would not have resolved all of the unfair labor practice charges. The ALJ noted that \"on that ground alone deferral is unwarranted.\u201d This suggests that the other stated reasons for refusing to defer \u2014 e.g., conflict of interest \u2014 were not necessary to the Board\u2019s decision, and, therefore, as to those other reasons, collateral estoppel would be inappropriate.
