        "text": "Lynch, J.\nThis is an appeal from a Superior Court judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s petition for judicial review of a decision of the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (department) and affirming the department\u2019s assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to G. L. c. 21 A, \u00a7 16 (1990 ed.). We transferred the case here on our own motion. Our decision turns on the interpretation of regulations, promulgated by the department pursuant to the Wetlands Protection Act, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (1990 ed.), which define the bodies of water over which the department has jurisdiction.\nFrom the decisions of the department\u2019s hearing officer we learn that the plaintiff, Francis G. Warcewicz, owns a parcel of land in Salisbury, Massachusetts. In 1977, Warcewicz created by excavation a \u201cstock pond\u201d or \u201cswimming pond\u201d to be used for recreational purposes. The size of the pond was approximately 41,000 square feet. It was bordered on all sides by vegetated wetlands approximately 20 feet wide, consisting of cattails, sedges, soft rush, and purple loosestrife. A small stream ran out of one corner of the pond. In 1986, despite an enforcement order from the department directing the plaintiff to cease and desist, the plaintiff filled in the pond and the bordering vegetated wetlands. The department then issued a second enforcement order, and assessed a penalty in the amount of $75,000 pursuant to the Civil Administrative Penalties Act, G. L. c. 21A, \u00a7 16. After a hearing, the department affirmed the enforcement order and the penalty, and the plaintiff sought judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1990 ed.), alleging in part that the department lacked jurisdiction over his pond. We now reverse the order of the Superior Court judge affirming the enforcement order.\nThe Wetlands Protection Act (act) prohibits the filling of any wetlands area bordering a pond, as well as the land under such pond, without receiving and complying with an order of conditions from the department. The regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to the act define \u201cpond\u201d as follows:\n\u201c \u2018Pond\u2019 (inland) means any open body of fresh water, either naturally occurring or man-made by impound- merit, with a surface area observed or recorded within the last ten (10) years of at least 10,000 square feet, and which is never without standing water due to natural causes, except during periods of extended drought. For purposes of this definition, extended drought shall mean any period of four (4) or more months during which the average rainfall for each month is 50 percent or less of the ten (10) year average for that same month. Basins or lagoons which are part of wastewater treatment plants shall not be considered ponds, nor shall swimming pools or other impervious man-made retention basins.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04 (1989). The regulations do not define \u201cimpoundment.\u201d\nThe plaintiff suggests that \u201cimpoundment\u201d requires a dam, or a restraining or diversion of water from its natural course. He claims that a pond created by excavation is not made \u201cby impoundment,\u201d and therefore, under its regulations the department has no jurisdiction over his pond.\nWe interpret a regulation in the same manner as a statute, and according to traditional rules of construction. Hellman v. Board of Registration in Medicine, 404 Mass. 800, 803 (1989). Thus, we accord the words of a regulation their usual and ordinary meaning. See Nantucket Conservation Found., Inc. v. Russell Management, Inc., 380 Mass. 212, 214 (1980); Department of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g v. Hingham, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 409, 411 (1983). We ordinarily accord an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation considerable deference. See Heilman, supra; Northbridge v. Natick, 394 Mass. 70, 74 (1985). However, this principle is deference, not abdication, and courts will not hesitate to overrule agency interpretations when those interpretations are arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the regulation itself. See Hellman, supra; Finkelstein v. Board of Registration in Optometry, 370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976); Crawford v. Cambridge, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 49 (1987); Morin v. Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 20 (1983); Cliff House Nursing Home, Inc. v. Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 306 (1983); Board of Educ. v. School Comm. of Amesbury, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 513-514 (1983); Amherst Nursing Home, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 638, 640-641 (1983).\nAn \u201cimpoundment\u201d is \u201ca body of water formed by impounding (as by a dam).\u201d \u201cTo impound\u201d means \u201cto collect (water) for irrigation, hydroelectric use, flood control, or similar purpose: confine and store (water) in an impound.\u201d The noun \u201cimpound\u201d means \u201ca reservoir for impounding.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1136 (1966).\nWe think that \u201cthe board in this case has given a strained interpretation to [the regulation] and that the plaintiff\u2019s [excavated pond] cannot be included fairly\u201d within the category of ponds man-made \u201cby impoundment.\u201d See Finkelstein, supra at 478. If the word \u201cimpoundment\u201d included ponds man-made by excavation, it is difficult to imagine any kind of man-made pond which would not then come under the department\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cWhere reasonably possible, no portion of the language of a regulation should be treated as surplusage.\u201d Bottomley v. Division of Admin. Law Appeals, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 652, 657 (1986), citing Morin v. Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra. See Hellman, supra. Unless the word \u201cimpoundment\u201d has some limiting effect, it is indeed superfluous, and the regulation might just as well provide that a pond includes any man-made body of water meeting the other requirements.\nThe department argues that it has defined \u201cimpoundment\u201d in the Hazardous Waste Regulations as including a facility man-made by excavation. However, the department\u2019s definition of the word in a different set of regulations, on a different subject, should not be imported to the regulations at issue. Cf. Massachusetts Medical Soc\u2019y v. Commissioner of Ins., 402 Mass. 44, 63 (1988); Beeler v. Downey, 387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982) (where specific language is used in one paragraph of a statute but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present). The language in the hazardous waste regulation simply shows that, if the department had wanted the definition of \u201cimpoundment\u201d in the instant regulation to include ponds man-made by excavation, it knew how to \u201cuse[ ] language better designed to make its intention clear.\u201d Finkelstein, supra at 479. However, once having exercised its power to promulgate regulations, the department may not infinitely manipulate or expand their content. See id. at 478.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court judge affirming the department\u2019s enforcement order.\nSo ordered.\nNow the Department of Environmental Protection.\nBecause of this result, we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s challenges to the civil administrative penalty.\nThe act provides in part: \u201cNo person shall remove, fill, dredge or alter any bank, fresh water wetland, coastal wetland, beach, dune, flat, marsh, meadow or swamp bordering on the ocean or on any estuary, creek, river, stream, pond, or lake, or any land under said waters or any land subject to . . . flooding, . . . without filing written notice of his intention . . . and without receiving and complying with an order of conditions provided all appeal periods have elapsed\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (1990 ed.)\nOnce it exhibited wetland characteristics and met other jurisdictional requirements.\nThose regulations define \u201cimpoundment\u201d as follows: \u201cSurface impoundment or impoundment means a facility or part of a facility which is a natural topographic depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials which is designed to or does hold an aggregation of liquid hazardous waste or waste containing free liquid, and which is not an injection well. This definition includes, without limitation, any depression, excavation, or diked area lined with man-made material without the strength to contain the liquid in the absence of earthen materials. Examples of surface impoundments are: holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.010 (1989).",
