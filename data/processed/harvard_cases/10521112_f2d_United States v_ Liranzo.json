        "text": "ALTIMARI, Circuit Judge:\nDefendants-appellants Juan Liranzo and Francisco Garcia appeal from judgments of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Robert J. Ward, Judge). The underlying superceding indictment charged the defendants in Count One with conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and in Count Two with distribution and possession with the intent to distribute approximately 1,300 grams of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 845a(a), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Following an eight-day jury trial, Liranzo and Garcia, together with co-defendants Rafael Gutierrez and Felix Guzman, were convicted on both counts.\nOn appeal, Liranzo claims that the district court erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding the government\u2019s alleged breach of a Proffer Agreement it had entered into with Liranzo. Garcia does not challenge his conviction, but contends that the district court erred in finding him to be a \u201ccareer offender\u201d pursuant to Sections 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cSentencing Guidelines\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d).\nFor the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of conviction as to Lir-anzo, but vacate the sentence of Garcia and remand for further, proceedings.\nBACKGROUND\nThe government\u2019s evidence at trial showed that in late 1989, Edison Ibarra, an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), was introduced to defendant Gutierrez, who had been identified as a broker for the sale of kilogram quantities of cocaine. In a series of meetings in New York, and at Ibarra\u2019s home in Massachusetts, Gutierrez and Ibarra discussed the potential sale to Ibarra of two kilograms of cocaine. Ibarra also spoke with Gutierrez several times by phone regarding the proposed sale, and eventually gave Gutierrez his beeper number. During these phone conversations, Ibarra also spoke with an individual identified as \u201cFrank.\u201d\nOn April 2, 1990, Ibarra traveled to New York. Gutierrez contacted him via the beeper and the two arranged to meet at 105th Street and Broadway to complete the transaction. In an afternoon meeting, which was observed by DEA agents, Gutierrez arrived in a white Lincoln Continental, accompanied by \u201cFrank,\u201d who was later identified as defendant-appellant Liran-zo. Gutierrez told Ibarra that he needed more time to obtain the cocaine. A second meeting conducted a few hours later yielded similar results.\nLater that afternoon, Ibarra received another \u201cbeeper\u201d call from Gutierrez. Gutierrez told Ibarra that he was ready to proceed with the deal, and the two arranged a third meeting at 105th Street and Broadway. During this call, Ibarra also spoke with another individual, identified at trial as defendant Guzman. Guzman, whom Gutierrez referred to as the \u201cowner\u201d of the cocaine, agreed to complete the .deal at the Broadway location. Thereafter, under the surveillance of DEA agents, Ibarra met with Gutierrez and Liranzo. Gutierrez introduced Liranzo as \u201cFrank.\u201d The trio then entered Ibarra\u2019s car, and Liranzo handed Ibarra a package containing 300 grams of cocaine. Ibarra said that he wanted to buy two kilos, not just 300 grams, and returned the package to Liran-zo. Liranzo put the cocaine in Ibarra\u2019s glove compartment and told Ibarra to lock it. The three men then exited Ibarra\u2019s car, and Gutierrez phoned Guzman, who agreed to bring the rest of the cocaine.\nGuzman arrived at 105th Street and Broadway. As Gutierrez and Ibarra approached Guzman, he motioned toward a brown Cutlass parked nearby that was driven by defendant-appellant Garcia. Gutierrez and Ibarra then walked to Garcia\u2019s car. Garcia handed Ibarra a package containing approximately one kilo of cocaine. Gutierrez and Ibarra then went to Ibarra\u2019s car to get the \u201cbuy\u201d money. At that point, DEA agents on the scene arrested Liranzo, Garcia, Gutierrez and Guzman.\nOn April 17, 1990, the government filed a two count indictment against the defendants. Count One charged the defendants with conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; Count Two charged them with distribution and possession with the intent to distribute approximately 1,300 grams of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 845a(a), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The overt acts section of the indictment indicated that the name \u201cFrank\u201d referred to appellant Garcia and, as such, identified Garcia as the individual who accompanied Gutierrez in the white Lincoln and handed Ibarra the 300 grams of cocaine.\nOn April 20, 1990, Liranzo and his attorney met with DEA agents and an Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) to explore Liranzo\u2019s possible cooperation. The meeting was held pursuant to a written Proffer Agreement that detailed the manner in which the government could use information supplied by Liranzo. Under the Proffer Agreement, the government could not offer statements made by Liran-zo in evidence in its case in chief. Significantly, however, the Agreement permitted the government to \u201cuse information derived directly or indirectly ... for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence\u201d which could be used by the government in prosecuting Liranzo. At the meeting, Lir-anzo stated, among other things, that he, and not Garcia, was the individual known as \u201cFrank.\u201d No cooperation agreement was entered into between Liranzo and the government.\nOn May 29, 1990, a superceding indictment was filed against the defendants. The indictment corrected certain factual errors in the original indictment, most notably the mistaken identification of Garcia as \u201cFrank.\u201d The government informed the court that after the proffer session, the government reviewed certain documents and debriefed certain witnesses to ascertain the identity of \u201cFrank.\u201d In particular, Ibarra was shown a photo array of the defendants and questioned as to the identity and activities of \u201cFrank.\u201d According to the government, Ibarra indicated that Lir-anzo, whose middle name is Francisco, was \u201cFrank.\u201d Ibarra stated that Liranzo had appeared with Gutierrez in the Lincoln and Liranzo had given him the 300 grams of cocaine. As a result of these statements, the government corrected the factual mistakes in the original indictment and filed the superceding indictment.\nLiranzo moved to dismiss the superced-ing indictment, contending, among other things, that the indictment tracked the substance of Liranzo\u2019s statements during his proffer session, thereby violating the Agreement. At a pre-trial hearing held on June 1, 1990, the government reiterated that the mistake in the original indictment as to the identity of \u201cFrank\u201d was corrected when, following the proffer session, the informant was shown a photo array and debriefed regarding the identity of \u201cFrank.\u201d The government also indicated that Ibarra, as well as one of the DEA agents who was present at the proffer session, and who met with Ibarra in connection with the debriefing, would testify at trial concerning the identification of \u201cFrank.\u201d The court therefore deferred ruling on Liranzo\u2019s motion until after trial.\nAn eight-day trial was held before Judge Ward and a jury. Prior to informant Ibar-ra\u2019s in-court identification of the defendants, the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the photo array showed to Ibarra during his pre-trial identification of Liranzo was unduly suggestive. See Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). The court found that the informant \u201cpossessed sufficient independent recollection\u201d of the defendants\u2019 roles in the transaction, and allowed the in-court identifications. The jury ultimately found all defendants guilty on both counts of the superceding indictment.\nPrior to sentencing, Liranzo moved for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that the government had breached the Proffer Agreement. The court denied the motion and refused to conduct an evidentia-ry hearing on the matter. The court reasoned that by permitting the government to make derivative use of Liranzo\u2019s statements to develop other evidence, the Agreement contained the \u201cbroadest possible waiver.\u201d The court observed that the government could have confronted Ibarra directly with Liranzo\u2019s proffered statements in order to gain or clarify information. Thus, interviewing Ibarra to clarify the \u201cFrank\u2019s\u201d identity did not violate the Proffer Agreement.\nThe district court proceeded to sentence the defendants. Liranzo received concurrent terms of 63 months imprisonment, eight years of supervised release, and a $100 assessment. Based in part on a prior state conviction for criminal facilitation, the court found Garcia to be a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and, as such, sentenced him to concurrent terms of 262 months imprisonment, eight years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Gutierrez, whose conviction has been previously affirmed, was sentenced to 96 months in prison and eight years of supervised release. Defendant Guzman is a fugitive from justice, and has not been sentenced. This appeal followed.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Liranzo\u2019s Proffer Agreement Claim.\nLiranzo contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment without conducting an evidentiary hearing on his claim that the government breached the Proffer Agreement. Liranzo argues that the government breached the Agreement by having its witnesses adopt Liranzo\u2019s proffer statements as their own, rather than by using information learned at the proffer session to refresh or clarify its witnesses\u2019 recollections.\nPre-trial agreements, such as cooperation agreements and proffer agreements, are interpreted according to principles of contract law. See United States v. Khan, 920 F.2d 1100, 1104 (2d Cir.1990), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1606, 113 L.Ed.2d 669 (1991); United States v. Rexach, 896 F.2d 710, 713 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 433, 112 L.Ed.2d 417 (1990); see also Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498-99, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201cA contract must be interpreted to give effect to the intent of the parties.\u201d Werbungs Und Commerz Union Austalt v. Collector\u2019s Guild Ltd., 930 F.2d 1021, 1025 (2d Cir.1991). Where the language of a contract is unambiguous, the parties\u2019 intent is discerned from the four corners of the contract. See Nicholas Laboratories Ltd. v. Almay, Inc., 900 F.2d 19, 21 (2d Cir.1990) (per curiam); International Klafter Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., 869 F.2d 96, 99 (2d Cir.1989). Because the interpretation of a contract is generally a question of law, our review of the district court\u2019s determination that the government did not breach the Proffer Agreement is de novo. See, e.g., Nicholas Laboratories, 900 F.2d at 21; Network Pub. Corp. v. Shapiro, 895 F.2d 97, 99 (2d Cir.1990).\nThe Proffer Agreement provides in relevant part:\nWith respect to the meeting of Juan Lir-anzo (\u201cClient\u201d), the following understandings exist:\n(1) Should any prosecutions be brought against Client by [the United States Attorney\u2019s] Office, the Government will not offer in evidence in its case in chief, ... any statements made by Client at the meeting....\n(2) Notwithstanding item (1) above: ... the Government may use the information derived directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client....\nAs an initial matter, we note that because the government offered none of Liranzo\u2019s statements into evidence during its case in chief, the government did not violate paragraph (1) of the Agreement. Under paragraph (2) of the Agreement, the government clearly was permitted to use information provided by Liranzo to \u201cobtain[ ] leads to other evidence.\u201d As the district court found, given this broad waiver, the government could have confronted Ibarra directly with Liranzo\u2019s statements in order to clarify or refresh his recollection regarding the identity of \u201cFrank.\u201d According to the government, it did not use Liranzo\u2019s statements directly in its debriefing of Ibarra, but showed him photographs of the defendants and asked questions to ascertain the identity of \u201cFrank.\u201d Once Ibarra identified Liranzo as \u201cFrank,\u201d the government filed the superceding indictment. Because the government could have used Liranzo\u2019s statements directly, its indirect use of the information was plainly permissible under paragraph (2) of the Agreement.\nLiranzo concedes that refreshing or clarifying Ibarra\u2019s recollection based on Liran-zo\u2019s proffer statements was permitted. He contends, however, that rather than refresh Ibarra\u2019s recollection, the government used Liranzo\u2019s statements to provide Ibar-ra with \u201can artificial source of testimony not truly evidentiary.\u201d Essentially, Liran-zo claims that the government had Ibarra change his testimony to conform to Liran-zo\u2019s proffer statements, thereby breaching its duty of good faith and fair dealing. This claim is unfounded. Both Ibarra and the DEA agents who debriefed him testified at trial and were subjected to vigorous cross-examination. As the district court recognized, Liranzo had ample opportunity to explore, and indeed did explore, any potential variance between Ibarra\u2019s recollection of events before, and after, Ibarra\u2019s post-proffer debriefing. Moreover, as a result of the Simmons hearing, the district court found that Ibarra had sufficient independent recollection of Liranzo to permit an in-court identification. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in finding, without conducting a separate hearing, that the government did not breach the Proffer Agreement by debriefing Ibarra as a result of Liranzo\u2019s proffer statements.\nII. Garcia\u2019s Challenge To His Sentence.\nThe \u201ccareer offender\u201d provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines are designed to increase substantially the sentences of those found to be career criminals. See United States v. Richardson, 923 F.2d 13, 15 (2d Cir.1991); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and \u00a7 4B1.2. Thus, once a defendant is found to be a \u201ccareer offender,\u201d his or her base offense level is increased significantly and the defendant is placed automatically in a criminal history category of VI. See Richardson, 923 F.2d at 15; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. To qualify as a career offender, a defendant must, among other things, have two prior felony convictions that are either a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The Guidelines define a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d to be \u201can offense under federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, or distribution of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance with the intent to manufacture, import, export, or distribute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(2). The Guidelines further provide that \u201cthe term[] \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 include[s] the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.\u201d See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment (n.l) (\u201cApplication Note 1\u201d).\nBased on a 1985 New York State conviction for the attempted criminal possession of cocaine, and on a 1987 New York State conviction for criminal facilitation in the second degree of the sale of cocaine, the district court found that Garcia had committed two \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d offenses and was therefore a \u201ccareer offender.\u201d The plain language of Application Note 1 made the \u201cattempt\u201d conviction a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d With regard to the conviction for criminal facilitation \u2014 an accessorial crime not involving the intent to commit the underlying offense, see N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 115.05 (McKinney 1987) \u2014 the court concluded that facilitation was sufficiently akin to \u201caiding and abetting\u201d to make the conviction a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Because the court found Garcia to be a \u201ccareer offender,\u201d Garcia\u2019s sentencing range went from 110 to 137 months to a range of 262 to 327 months. The court ultimately sentenced Garcia to 262 months in prison.\nOn appeal, Garcia contends that the district court erred in finding that his conviction for criminal facilitation constituted a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines. Specifically, Garcia argues that unlike the crime of aiding and abetting, or the other crimes listed in Application Note 1, the crime of criminal facilitation does not involve the intent to commit a narcotics offense and therefore should not serve as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of imposing \u201ccareer offender\u201d status under the Guidelines. In contrast, the government argues that because Application Note 1 provides that a \u201c \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 includefs] the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring and attempting to commit such offenses,\u201d the Commission intended that the list not be exhaustive and that crimes other than those listed, e.g., criminal facilitation, could be a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Echoing the district court\u2019s reasoning, the government contends that the list of crimes in Application Note 1 is not exhaustive because in formulating the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission could not anticipate differences in the statutory definitions of crimes in all 50 states.\nWhile we acknowledge, as did the district court, that the Commission could not anticipate definitional deviations in state law from the \u201cclassic terminology\u201d of \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d we do not believe that the Commission intended that all crimes involving some type of accessorial conduct would constitute \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d offenses under the Guidelines. Although Application Note 1 may not be an exhaustive list, the question remains whether the crime of criminal facilitation should be included in that list. Because resolution of this issue entails a purely legal interpretation of the Guidelines, our review of the district court\u2019s determination is de novo. See United States v. Churria, 919 F.2d 842, 849 (2d Cir.1990).\nA person commits criminal facilitation in the second degree when:\n... believing it probable that he [or she] is rendering aid to a person who intends to commit a class A felony ... he [or she] engages in conduct which provides such person with means or opportunity for the commission thereof and which in fact aids such person to commit such class A felony.\nN.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 115.05 (McKinney 1987). Criminal facilitation involves conduct \u201cin which the actor aids the commission of a crime with knowledge that he is doing so but without any specific intent to participate therein or to benefit therefrom.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 115.05, Practice Commentaries (quoting Staff Notes of the Commission on Revision of the Penal Law and Criminal Code, Proposed New York Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Spec. Pamph.1964). Therefore, unlike the crimes of aiding and abetting, conspiracy, or attempt, the crime of criminal facilitation does not involve the intent to commit the underlying substantive offense. Compare, e.g., People v. Kaplan 76 N.Y.2d 140, 146, 556 N.E.2d 415, 418, 556 N.Y.S.2d 976, 979 (1990) (discussing criminal facilitation) with United States v. Wiley, 846 F.2d 150, 154 (2d Cir.1988) (aiding and abetting); N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 20.00 (McKinney 1987) (accomplice liability); United States v. Durham, 825 F.2d 716, 719 (2d Cir.1987) (conspiracy); People v. Schwimmer, 66 A.D.2d 91, 411 N.Y.S.2d 922, 925 (2d Dep\u2019t 1978) (same); United States v. Delvecchio, 816 F.2d 859, 861 (2d Cir.1987) (attempt); People v. Campbell, 72 N.Y.2d 602, 605, 532 N.E.2d 86, 87-88, 535 N.Y.S.2d 580, 581 (1988) (same). As a result, unlike an \u201caider and abetter,\u201d a mere facilitator is not an \u201caccomplice\u201d under New York law. See Kaplan, 76 N.Y.2d at 146, 556 N.E.2d at 418, 556 N.Y.S.2d at 979; N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 20.-00. The New York Court of Appeals has thus explained that a facilitator\u2019s conduct, as distinguished, for example, from that of an \u201caider and abetter,\u201d is \u201cconfined to preparation so attenuated from the final stages that the role of the facilitator is only remotely related as a cause or contributor to the ultimate crime.\u201d People v. Beaudet, 32 N.Y.2d 371, 298 N.E.2d 647, 345 N.Y.S.2d 495 (1973).\nThe \u201cprior convictions\u201d requirement of the Guidelines\u2019 \u201ccareer offender\u201d provision is to be interpreted strictly. See United States v. Delvecchio, 920 F.2d 810, 812 (11th Cir.1991). In light of the drastically enhanced sentences applied to \u201ccareer offenders,\u201d we do not believe, absent clear guidance from the Sentencing Commission, that the Commission intended that a conviction for a crime such as criminal facilitation \u2014 a crime not involving the mental culpability to commit a substantive narcotics offense \u2014 would serve as a predicate \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for the imposition of \u201ccareer offender\u201d status under the Guidelines. Since Garcia\u2019s conviction for criminal facilitation cannot count as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d we vacate Garcia\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, the judgment of conviction of Liranzo is affirmed. The sentence of Garcia is vacated and the case remanded to the district court for resen-tencing.",
