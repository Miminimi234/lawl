        "text": "MESKILL, Circuit Judge:\nArticle 17 of the Warsaw Convention, Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, Oct. 12, 1929, 49 Stat. 3000, T.S. No. 876 (1934), 49 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1502 note (1988) (\u201cWarsaw Convention\u201d or \u201cConvention\u201d) establishes conditions under which an international air carrier can be held liable for injuries to its passengers. This appeal requires us to determine whether an aircraft mechanic assigned to specific flights of a cargo carrier is a \u201cpassenger\u201d within the meaning of the Convention. Confronted with cross-motions for summary judgment, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Conboy, J., ruled as a matter of law that appellant's husband, Leonard Su-lewski, was not a \u201cpassenger\u201d when a cargo carrier to which he was assigned crashed, killing all aboard. The court therefore granted appellee Federal Express Corporation\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. We agree and affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nLeonard Sulewski worked for the cargo carrier, Flying Tiger Line, Inc. He was employed as an aircraft mechanic and performed maintenance and repairs on Flying Tiger aircraft. Unlike most aircraft mechanics in Flying Tiger\u2019s employ, Sulewski was not assigned to one of the airports on the cargo carrier\u2019s worldwide routes. As one of seven members of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d he was assigned to specific flights that were scheduled to land at airports where Flying Tiger did not employ aircraft mechanics. Because Sulewski was not assigned to an airport, he used his home in New Jersey as a base. From there, Flying Tiger assigned him to duty on specific flights.\nA collective bargaining agreement governed Sulewski\u2019s employment relationship with Flying Tiger. Under the agreement, Sulewski received his monthly salary irrespective of what he did for the carrier during a given month as long as he performed his duties with respect to the flights to which he was assigned. The parties stipulated that Sulewski performed the following duties:\n1. the supervising [of] the aircraft ground handling and fueling;\n2. the responsibility for clearance of all log book items;\n3. the pre-flight and post-flight inspections on the aircraft for the flight he was assigned to;\n4. the communication to Flying Tiger maintenance control of any change in the airworthiness of the aircraft upon arrival at any location[.]\nEach month Flying Tiger established a flight schedule for its seven traveling mechanics. According to one of these schedules, Sulewski was assigned to a series of flights in February 1989, to run from February 14 to February 18. Pursuant to this timetable, Sulewski boarded Flying Tiger Flight 77 at Los Angeles on February 14. Flight 77 proceeded to Honolulu, Hawaii, to Nandi (the Fiji Islands), to Auckland, New Zealand and finally to Sydney, Australia. The schedule then assigned Sulewski to Flight 9077, which was to travel from Melbourne, Australia to Singapore. After arranging independent transportation from Sydney to Melbourne, Sulewski boarded Flight 9077 on February 17 and flew to Singapore.\nThe schedule next directed Sulewski to hold in Singapore until February 18 for his next assignment, Flight 66, which was scheduled to fly from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and then to Hong Kong. Flying Tiger permanently stationed aircraft mechanics in Singapore and Hong Kong, but not in Kuala Lumpur, the intermediate stop of Flight 66. Pursuant to Flying Tiger\u2019s custom, Sulewski was not issued a passenger ticket for the flight. Flight 66 left Singapore on schedule on the morning of February 18. Regrettably, as the plane approached the runway at the Kuala Lumpur airport, it struck a ridge line and crashed, killing the pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, and Sulewski.\nHad Flight 66 not crashed in Kuala Lum-pur, it would have proceeded to Hong Kong, where Sulewski\u2019s duties on this particular tour would have concluded. In Hong Kong he would have been debriefed and \u201cdestaged,\u201d that is, asked by Hong Kong-based Flying Tiger mechanics whether there were any problems with the aircraft. Once his responsibilities in Hong Kong had been completed, he would have been free to arrange his own transportation home via either a private passenger airline, for which he would have been reimbursed, or a Flying Tiger flight. Had he flown home on a Flying Tiger plane, he would have been off duty and therefore in a \u201cdeadhead\u201d status.\nSulewski\u2019s wife, Dolores, brought an action against Federal Express Corporation, the successor-in-interest to Flying Tiger. Relying on the liability provisions of the Warsaw Convention and on common law negligence, she sought compensatory damages for her husband\u2019s wrongful death.\nAfter extensive discovery, Federal Express and Dolores Sulewski each moved for summary judgment. Federal Express claimed that Sulewski was not a passenger on Flight 66 because he was traveling as an on-duty employee who had been assigned by his employer to the ill-fated flight. Therefore, reasoned Federal Express, workers\u2019 compensation represented plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy. Dolores Su-lewski countered that because her husband\u2019s duties only could be performed on the ground and because he had no specific responsibilities in the air, he was indeed traveling as a passenger on Flight 66.\nThe court framed the question presented by the cross-motions for summary judgment in this way: \u201cwhether Leonard Su-lewski \u2018was aboard the flight primarily to perform ... [his] employment obligations, so that [he] was not a \u201cpassenger.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Sulewski v. Federal Express Corp., 749 F.Supp. 506, 511 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (quoting In re Mexico City Aircrash of October 31, 1979, 708 F.2d 400, 418 (9th Cir.1983)) (bracketed words inserted by district court). Relying primarily on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Mexico City Aircrash, the district court held as a matter of law that Sulewski was not a \u201cpassenger\u201d on Flight 66. The court accordingly granted Federal Express\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. Dolores Su-lewski appealed, contending that (1) the district court applied an inappropriate test for determining \u201cpassenger\u201d status, (2) the court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment, and (3) material factual disputes precluded the court from entering summary judgment against her.\nDISCUSSION\nOur review of summary judgment decisions follows a familiar pattern: review is de novo, Burtnieks v. City of New York, 716 F.2d 982, 985 (2d Cir.1983); we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, City of Yonkers v. Otis Elevator Co., 844 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir.1988); the moving party is entitled to summary judgment if he can \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact[,]\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); and \u201cthe substantive law will identify which facts are material,\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nWhether a material factual dispute exists in this case turns on the meaning of the term \u201cpassenger\u201d in the Warsaw Convention. As an international treaty to which the United States is a member, the Warsaw Convention is \u201c \u2018equal in stature and force to the domestic laws of the United States.\u2019 \u201d In re Air Crash Disaster at Warsaw, Poland, 705 F.2d 85, 87 (2d Cir.) (quoting Smith v. Canadian Pacific Airways, Ltd., 452 F.2d 798, 801 (2d Cir.1971)), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 845, 104 S.Ct. 147, 78 L.Ed.2d 138 (1982). To ascertain the meaning of treaties, \u201c \u2018we may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties,\u2019 \u201d Air France v. Saks, 470 U.S. 392, 396, 105 S.Ct. 1338, 1341, 84 L.Ed.2d 289 (1985) (quoting Choctaw Nation of Indians v. United States, 318 U.S. 423, 431-32, 63 S.Ct. 672, 677-78, 87 L.Ed. 877 (1943)), in order to \u201c \u2018give the specific words of the treaty a meaning consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties.\u2019 \u201d Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, \u2014 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 1489, 113 L.Ed.2d 569 (1991) (quoting Saks, 470 U.S. at 399, 105 S.Ct. at 1342). We must start our analysis, however, with the pertinent provisions of the treaty. Saks, 470 U.S. at 397, 105 S.Ct. at 1341. The accuracy of the French to English translation that follows is not contested.\nArticle 1\n(1) This convention shall apply to all international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft for hire. It shall apply equally to gratuitous transportation by aircraft performed by an air transportation enterprise.\n(2) For the purpose of this convention the expression \u201cinternational transportation\u201d shall mean any transportation in which, according to the contract made by the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the transportation or a transshipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of another power, even though that power is not a party to this convention. Transportation without such an agreed stopping place between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party shall not be deemed to be international for the purposes of this convention.\nArticle 17\nThe carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\n(emphasis added).\nThe text of the Convention eliminates several potential tests for determining the meaning of \u201cpassenger.\u201d To start with, passenger status does not hinge on whether the person was a fare-paying traveler. That construction would conflict with Article 1(1), which states that the Convention \u201cshall apply equally to gratuitous transportation by aircraft performed by an air transportation enterprise.\u201d (emphasis added). The reference to \u201cgratuitous transportation\u201d also indicates that, as long as the carrier is commercial (\u201can air transportation enterprise\u201d), the nature of the carrier\u2019s business should not be dispositive. As a result, Flying Tiger, although in the business of carrying cargo, may be held liable not only for accident-related damages to transported \u201cgoods\u201d but also for injuries to \u201cpersons\u201d to whom it provides \u201cgratuitous transportation.\u201d The \u201cgratuitous transportation\u201d provision further suggests that there is no bright line rule as to whether employees of an air carrier may be passengers. If, for instance, a carrier offers \u201cgratuitous transportation\u201d to its employees as a perquisite of the job, then the carrier\u2019s traveling employees presumably could be passengers under the Convention. This might occur if the carrier provided free transportation to \u201cdeadheading\u201d employees. Finally, passenger status does not depend on whether the carrier issued a ticket to the person for the flight. Article 3(2) of the Convention states that \u201cif the carrier accepts a passenger without a passenger ticket having been delivered he shall not be entitled to avail himself of those provisions of this convention which exclude or limit his liability.\u201d By clear implication, the carrier may be held liable for the deaths of non-ticketed travelers, such as Sulewski. In fact, because Leonard Sulewski was not issued a ticket for Flight 66, the $75,000 liability limitations the Convention places on the recovery for a passenger\u2019s death would not apply in this instance. See Convention, art. 3(2).\nThis brings us to the positive question: What persons does the Convention cover? Article 1(1) states that the Convention shall apply \u201cto all international transportation of persons.\u201d This broad language suggests a presence test for \u201cpassenger\u201d status, one that would render air carriers liable for the accident-related deaths of any person aboard an air carrier, crew members and employees included. The expansive language of article 1(1), however, is limited by articles 1(2) and 17.\nArticle 1(2) indicates that the application of the Convention \u2014 whether there is an \u201cinternational transportation\u201d \u2014 shall be determined \u201caccording to the contract made by the parties.\u201d This reference to the parties\u2019 \u201ccontract\u201d implies that carrier liability requires a contract of carriage \u2014 \u201ca promise, an undertaking, on the part of the carrier to transport the passenger, and the consent of the passenger.\u201d Block v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, 386 F.2d 323, 333 (5th Cir.1967), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 905, 88 S.Ct. 2053, 20 L.Ed.2d 1363 (1968). As Judge Wisdom wrote in Block:\nThe common [denominator] of all Warsaw contracts of carriage is the consent of the carrier to transport the passenger (or goods) and the consent of the passenger (or shipper) that the transport take place. \u201cThe contract of carriage represents the sale and purchase of transportation of persons and goods, i.e. an obligation to carry passengers or goods from one place to another.\u201d\nId. at 334 (quoting Gronfors, Air Charter and the Warsaw Convention 60 (The Hague 1956)). Another provision of the Convention, article 33, also intimates that carrier liability requires a contract of carriage: \u201cNothing contained in this convention shall prevent the carrier ... from refusing to enter into any contract of transportation.\u201d See also art. 1(3) (referring to a \u201csingle contract or ... a series of contracts\u201d). In accordance with these provisions, courts and commentators have noted that a stowaway \u2014 a person who undoubtedly lacks a contract of carriage \u2014 could not recover under the Warsaw Convention for injuries suffered during a plane crash. See, e.g., Block, 386 F.2d at 334; Matte, Treatise on Air-Aeronautical Law 385 (1981). In short, the Convention does not cover the transportation of all persons, only those who board the plane pursuant to a contract of carriage.\nArticle 17, the liability provision, further shortens article l(l)\u2019s reach. Carriers may be held liable under article 17 for injuries to \u201cpassengers.\u201d The dictionary offers three definitions of \u201cpassenger:\u201d (1) \u201cone who passes by\u201d (i.e., a \u201ctraveler\u201d or \u201cwayfarer\u201d), (2) \u201ca traveler in a public conveyance,\u201d or (3) \u201ca member of a group ... that contributes little or nothing to the functioning or productivity of the group.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1650 (1971). \u201cTraveler,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cone that travels\u201d or \u201cone that goes on a trip or journey.\u201d Id. at 2433. These definitions, while less than explicit, suggest that a \u201cpassenger\u201d undertakes a journey primarily for the simple pleasure of traveling (\u201cone who passes by\u201d) or for the mundane purpose of going from point A to point B (\u201cone who travels\u201d). Carrier liability for the injuries or deaths of \u201cpassengers,\u201d then, requires something more than the person\u2019s presence aboard the carrier. It requires, first, that the person board the carrier pursuant to a contract of carriage and, second, that the carriage be undertaken for the primary purpose either of going from one place to another or for the recreational enjoyment of the journey itself.\nOur reading of \u201cpassenger\u201d is consistent with the primary aim of the contracting parties to the Convention: \u201climiting the liability of air carriers in order to foster the growth of the fledging commercial aviation industry.\u201d Floyd, 111 S.Ct. at 1499. Neither party, in any event, has pointed to any aspect of the negotiating history of the Convention that supports a contrary interpretation of \u201cpassenger.\u201d Nor have we uncovered any. The only other circuit to consider this question reached a similar conclusion. See Mexico City Aircrash, 708 F.2d 400 (9th Cir.1983). Construing \u201ctransportation of persons\u201d in an effort to define \u201cpassenger,\u201d the Ninth Circuit held:\nThe term \u201ctransportation\u201d seems to us to require as a minimum that the voyage be undertaken for the principal purpose of moving the individual from point A to point B. In the cases of [the working flight attendants], the voyages were undertaken not for this reason, but for the exclusive purpose of performing employment duties.\nId. at 417 (emphasis added). Moreover, our interpretation comports with the views of the commentators we have found who have considered this discrete question. Relying on several French cases, one commentator concluded:\n[M]ere physical presence on board an aircraft in flight [has been] held to be insufficient to characterize the operation as a \u2018carriage.\u2019 In addition to the fact of carriage, French courts require that the essential purpose of the presence on board the aircraft is transportation, and not any other purpose such as teaching flying techniques, or testing a plane. In such eases, the fact of being carried on the plane is not the essential aim of the operation; it is only accessory \u2014 albeit necessary \u2014 to the essential purpose of the flight. Several French decisions have made it clear that when this is the case, the liability has to be assessed on a basis other than the Warsaw Convention.\nMiller, Liability in International Air Transport 8 (1977) (internal citations omitted). See also Goldhirsch, The Warsaw Convention Annotated: A Legal Handbook 10 (1988) (\u201ccases seem to distinguish between passengers who are carried in connection with their duties and those carried as an accommodation\u201d); Matte, supra at 385 (damages suffered by carrier employees are not governed by the Convention because \u201cemployees are covered by a contract of hire, which already exists before the flight, between the carrier and his employees\u201d).\nApplying this interpretation, we conclude as a matter of law that Leonard Sulewski was not a passenger on Flight 66. The material facts are undisputed. Flying Tiger assigned Sulewski to Flight 66. The February schedule for Flying Tiger\u2019s traveling mechanics indicated that Sulewski was to hold in Singapore until February 18 and then to board Flight 66. On February 18, Flying Tiger did not permanently station an aircraft mechanic at the Kuala Lumpur airport, the intermediate stop for Flight 66, thus necessitating Sulewski\u2019s assignment to the flight in accordance with Flying Tiger\u2019s policy for deploying aircraft mechanics. The primary reason Sulewski boarded Flight 66 thus was to fulfill his employment obligations \u2014 ensuring the safety of the aircraft as it traveled to and from airports where Flying Tiger did not employ aircraft mechanics. Furthermore, in view of his assignment to the flight, it cannot be said that Sulewski boarded the plane in accordance with a contract of carriage; his pre-existing contract of employment and his work assignment were the reasons he boarded the flight. We reach this conclusion even though most, if not all, of Sulewski\u2019s hands-on duties as a mechanic were confined to those instances when the Flying Tiger planes were on the ground.\nSulewski\u2019s position with Flying Tiger was sui generis. In contrast to most crew members of an aircraft, gravity compelled that the bulk of his services be performed after the plane landed and before it again became airborne. He was not a member of the flying, or operational, crew. Nor did he regularly provide other in-flight services such as those a steward would. Nonetheless, Flying Tiger required Sulewski to be on the plane. Sulewski was not simply a commuter who had the option of choosing his own mode of transportation to reach his place of employment. Flying Tiger assigned him to specific flights and, as the affidavit of one of Sulewski\u2019s supervisors, T.E. Moore, makes clear, Flying Tiger required him to be on those flights:\n[I]t was the policy of Flying Tiger that the maintenance representatives had to accompany the flight to which they were assigned unless special permission from the company was sought and received. The purpose of the policy was to insure that the maintenance representative would be at the off-line station ready to perform his \u201con ground\u201d duties while the aircraft was being loaded and unloaded so that the flight would remain on schedule. Having the maintenance representative on board the aircraft also protected against situations where the aircraft had to be diverted to an alternate off-line airport because of weather conditions or political unrest.\nThat Flying Tiger may have allowed its traveling mechanics to alter their flight schedules, by obtaining pre-flight consent, does not alter the critical fact that they were assigned to specific flights. Absent permission, it violated company policy for a traveling mechanic such as Sulewski not to fly on his scheduled flight.\nIn characterizing Sulewski\u2019s status on Flight 66, it is interesting to note what his status would have been had Flight 66 proceeded safely to Hong Kong, its final destination. Once the plane had landed in Hong Kong and Sulewski had briefed Flying Tiger mechanics stationed in Hong Kong about the plane\u2019s maintenance status, Su-lewski\u2019s duties on this particular tour would have concluded. He then would have been free to return home on a plane of his choice. Had he flown home courtesy of Flying Tiger, he would have been off-duty, that is, in a \u201cdeadhead\u201d status. In that capacity, he would have been a \u201cpassenger,\u201d because he would have been on the flight primarily for the purpose of going from point A to point B, not because his employer required him to be on the plane.\nDolores Sulewski urges us to adopt a different construction of \u201cpassenger.\u201d She maintains that the test is whether the person \u201cwas primarily on the flight to perform job responsibilities in the air\u201d (emphasis added). Conceding that her husband boarded Flight 66 in the scope and course of his employment, she argues that he was a \u201cpassenger\u201d nonetheless because he did not have any in-flight responsibilities. She claims that Mexico City Aircrash supports this argument. We disagree.\nIn Mexico City Aircrash, the Ninth Circuit considered whether article 17 of the Warsaw Convention covered the deaths of three flight attendants. The court had little trouble finding the Convention inapplicable to two of the flight attendants. Noting that these two decedents \u201cwere indisputably working as flight attendants on board Flight 2605,\u201d the court found that they were not \u201cpassengers\u201d and granted summary judgment in favor of the airline. Mexico City Aircrash, 708 F.2d at 417. The court reached a different conclusion with respect to the third flight attendant, Yikki Dzida. She was a \u201cdeadheading\u201d employee, based in Los Angeles, who was traveling from Los Angeles to Mexico City to take an assigned duty on a flight departing from Mexico City. Dzida received full pay and half flight time credit for her time aboard the fatal flight. The court refused to hold as a matter of law that Dzida was not a passenger, leaving the following question for a jury to resolve: \u201cThe ultimate inquiry is whether Dzida was on Flight 2605 for the primary purpose of traveling from Los Angeles to Mexico City, so that she was a \u2018passenger,\u2019 or whether she was aboard the flight primarily to perform (or to be on call to perform) her employment obligations, so that she was not a \u2018passenger.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 418.\nThe crux of Dolores Sulewski\u2019s argument is that her husband stands in the same shoes as Vikki Dzida. The rationale expressed by the Ninth Circuit for its decision concerning Dzida, however, undermines this analogy. The court stated that two factors made summary judgment inappropriate. First, the court observed that the record \u201cdoes not reveal whether she was commuting from her home to her job assignment.\u201d Id. at 417. Second, the court was concerned that the record\nalso does not tell whether Dzida was contractually obligated to be on board Flight 2605, or whether she was free to choose any method of transport that would get her to Mexico City in time to assume her duty assignment. If the latter situation prevailed, we believe that Dzida qualified as a \u201cpassenger\u201d covered by the Convention.\nId. at 417-18 (emphasis added). Neither of these rationales applies to Sulewski. Su-lewski was not commuting from his home to his job assignment at the time of the flight. His employment position required him to be aboard Flight 66. What is more, Sulewski was indeed \u201ccontractually obligated to be on board Flight [66].\u201d Flying Tiger assigned him to that flight so that he would be at Kuala Lumpur when the plane landed in order to perform his post-flight duties and subsequently his preflight duties. That Sulewski may have been able to get \u201cspecial permission\u201d to alter his flight schedule does not alter this conclusion. He was required to be on the flight until his employer told him, or permitted him, to do otherwise. Thus the rationale for the Ninth Circuit's treatment of Dzida does not apply in this instance.\nFurthermore, Mexico City Aircrash does not establish a per se rule that the employee perform in-flight services in order to achieve non-passenger status. A non-passenger, the court said, is one \u201caboard the flight primarily to perform (or to be on call to perform) her employment obligations.\u201d Id. at 418 (emphasis added). An employee such as Sulewski may be aboard a flight \u201cprimarily to perform\u201d employment duties even if those duties are necessarily limited to the times immediately after the plane lands and before it takes off. Moreover, in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, it is sufficient if the employee is \u201con call to perform\u201d employment services. Although Sulewski typically had few if any responsibilities during the in-air portion of a flight, his duties, as the one primarily responsible for the maintenance and safety of the plane, certainly encompassed being \u201con call\u201d to give technical advice to the operational crew members in the event of mechanical problems during a flight. The affidavit of John Smith supports this commonsensieal view of the traveling mechanic\u2019s duties during a flight: \u201cif there was an instrument malfunction or some other problem during the in-air portion of the flight to which he was assigned, the role of mechanic would be that of a consultant with the flying crew members.\u201d In any event, even if we were to read Mexico City Aircrash as requiring that an employee have in-flight duties to be a non-passenger, we would not adopt such a rule here. That Sulewski\u2019s primary purpose for being on Flight 66 was to facilitate the departure and arrival of the flight, in accordance with his unique employment responsibilities, provides sufficiently compelling evidence to rule as a matter of law that he was not a \u201cpassenger\u201d within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention.\nThe above analysis renders immaterial the remaining facts and alleged factual disputes that Dolores Sulewski proffers as grounds for reversing the judgment below. The location of Sulewski\u2019s body in the wreckage does not affect this analysis. Nor do the conflicting post-accident reports labelling Sulewski as a passenger in some instances and a crew member in others. Finally, both parties have argued that definitions of \u201ccrew\u201d in other legal contexts support their analysis. Because these cases were not brought under the Warsaw Convention and did not deal with the unique characteristics of the airline industry, we have not found them to be helpful in our analysis.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.",
