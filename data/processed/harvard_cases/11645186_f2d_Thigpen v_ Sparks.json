        "text": "EDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge:\nThe issue in this case is whether an individual\u2019s breach of warranty claims, which arose when a now-failed bank sold him a wholly-owned Texas trust company, are barred against FDIC by the D\u2019Oench doctrine, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e) or \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A). We hold that they were not so barred and thus reverse and remand the district court\u2019s summary judgment.\nBACKGROUND\nAppellant Marc A. Sparks purchased a Texas trust company called The Dallas Empire Company (DEC) from BancTexas, Dallas, planning to sell it afterward. Both Sparks and Roy Thigpen, III, the prospective purchaser, required that DEC have a \u201ccontinuous, uninterrupted corporate charter\u201d as a condition to purchase. By letter dated May 8, 1986, the Chairman of the Board and CEO of the bank represented to Sparks, among other things, that DEC \u201chas had a continuous and uninterrupted status of good standing through this present date.\u201d One week later, Sparks bought DEC for $45,000. The May 15 bill of sale warranted that DEC was in good corporate standing at that time.\nBefore the sale to Thigpen, for which Sparks was to receive $150,000, Sparks learned that DEC\u2019S charter had been forfeited briefly for non-payment of corporate franchise taxes in 1985. Despite the charter\u2019s reinstatement, Thigpen refused to purchase DEC and sued Sparks, BancTexas and another individual in state court for violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Counter-claims and cross-claims were filed. By autumn, 1987, the state court had granted summary judgment in favor of the bank on Thigpen\u2019s and Sparks\u2019s DTPA claims and dismissed Thig-pen\u2019s original petition with prejudice. Only Sparks\u2019s breach of warranty claims against the bank remain. BancTexas was declared insolvent in January 1990, and FDIC was appointed its receiver. Substituted as a party defendant for the bank in state court, FDIC removed the case to federal court and some months later filed a motion for summary judgment on Sparks\u2019s claims.\nThe district court held that Sparks\u2019s claims against FDIC are barred by the relatively new FIRREA provision that states in pertinent part:\n\u201c[A]ny agreement which does not meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 13(e) [12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e) ] shall not form the basis of, or substantially comprise, a claim against the receiver or the Corporation.\u201d\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A), effective in September, 1989. The requirements incorporated in that provision from 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e) include that the agreement be in writing, executed by both parties contemporaneously with the \u201cacquisition of the asset\u201d by the institution, and be continuously maintained among the institution\u2019s business records. FDIC offered an affidavit of Linda Bratton, one of its employees, to attest that no documents in BancTexas\u2019s files reflected whether the sale of DEC to Sparks, or the May 8 letter, had been approved by the bank\u2019s board of directors. The Court found this affidavit, unanswered by Sparks, conclusive against him for purposes of \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A).\nSparks moved for reconsideration on several grounds. First, he contended that because the DEC transaction constituted a sale of an asset by the bank, it did not fall within the purview of D\u2019Oench, \u00a7 1823(e) or \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) as a matter of law. If \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) was necessary to make the \u00a7 1823(e) requirements applicable to Sparks\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d against FDIC, he contended, then \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) was being improperly retroactively applied, for it became effective in September 1989, while the DEC transaction occurred in 1986. Finally, he moved for an opportunity to conduct discovery to counter the Bratton affidavit. Because the bank had defended Sparks\u2019s case on the merits, he was not forewarned by FDIC\u2019s substitution that he might have to produce evidence to show that the DEC sale had complied with 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e). The district court denied the motion for reconsideration and this appeal followed.\nDISCUSSION\nSparks undertakes a four-fold attack on appeal. He disputes that \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) applies retroactively to his claims against FDIC. He contends that D\u2019Oench and \u00a7 1823(e) do not apply to the DEC transaction. Even if those rules did apply, he maintains that FDIC did not carry its summary judgment burden. Finally, he asserts that if any of these avoiding doctrines are available to FDIC, the district court abused its discretion in not allowing further discovery. FDIC takes issue with each of these propositions.\nOur analysis begins with a threshold question that the parties have not resolved. The linchpin of Sparks\u2019s argument and conversely, the Achilles heel of FDIC\u2019s response, is an assumption that the May 8 letter from the president of BancTexas is part of the agreement by which DEC was sold. If it was part of that agreement\u2014 and Texas has a doctrine that a contract may consist of multiple writings\u2014then D\u2019Oench does not logically apply. The D\u2019Oench doctrine was formulated to protect the integrity of bank insolvency proceedings by making secret agreements between banks and preferred customers unenforceable. According to Sparks\u2019s theory, however, BancTexas profited by selling DEC under the very same written agreement whose alleged warranty of continuing corporate existence FDIC now seeks to escape. If this is correct, Sparks\u2019s case would be analogous to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Laguarta, 939 F.2d 1231, 1237-39 (5th Cir.1991), in which we held that a borrower could assert an affirmative defense, notwithstanding D\u2019Oench Duhme, because the defense arose from an express written obligation undertaken by the bank in the loan agreement with the borrower. This court concluded that because the funding obligations on which LaGuarta premised his claims were spelled out in the parties\u2019 loan agreement and modification agreement, the D\u2019Oench doctrine was inapplicable. 939 F.2d at 1239. The court cited with approval a district court decision interpreting \u00a7 1823(e), the original provision based on D\u2019Oench:\nNone of the policies that favor the invocation of this statute are present in such cases because the terms of the agreement that tend to diminish the rights of the FDIC appear in writing on the face of the agreement that the FDIC seeks to enforce.\nRiverside Park Realty Co. v. FDIC, 465 F.Supp. 305, 313 (M.D.Tenn.1978).\nIn Laguarta, however, there was no question whether the borrower\u2019s loan agreement and modification agreement were collateral to the promissory note; as the court observed, they were integral to the loan transaction. Here, that is not necessarily the case. Indeed, FDIC has assumed that the May 8 letter was collateral to the bill of sale for DEC. From this assumption proceed FDIC\u2019s arguments that the May 8 letter did not separately comply with D\u2019Oench or \u00a7 1823(e).\nAs we view it, the threshold question is whether that letter was part of the parties\u2019 agreement of sale of DEC or whether it was subsumed by the parol evidence rule or a similar principle and did not become part of the parties\u2019 final agreement. Before FDIC entered this case, BancTexas and Sparks had begun to brief this question on summary judgment, but neither the state nor the federal court ever ruled on it. On remand, the court must answer this question. If the May 8 letter was not, under Texas law, part of the documents comprising the DEC sale contract, then Sparks cannot prevail because he has no right to rely on that letter\u2019s representations. If the May 8 letter was part of the contract, then FDIC prevails only if the DEC sale to Sparks had to be documented pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e) or \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A).\nSparks argues here as he did to the trial court that \u00a7 1823(e) does not apply at all to the DEC sale or, if it does, it only applies by an impermissibly retroactive application of \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A). We are inclined to agree that \u00a7 1823(e) does not apply to a claim arising from a bank\u2019s sale of an asset in a nonbanking transaction. Section 1823(e) provides in full as follows:\nNo agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the Corporation in any asset acquired by it under this section or section 1821 of this title, either as security for a loan or by purchase or as receiver of any insured depository institution, shall be valid against the Corporation unless such agreement\u2014\n(1) is in writing,\n(2) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution,\n(3) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and\n(4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution. (Emphasis added).\nThis case would represent a unique application of \u00a7 1823(e) because the gist of the dispute is neither a loan transaction, actual or contemplated, between a borrower and lender nor a conventional banking transaction of any kind, but rather the bank\u2019s sale of an asset to Sparks, an individual who on the record before us had no other connection with the bank than by his purchase of DEC. That the May 15, 1986 sale of DEC, even considered with the bank\u2019s assumption of a warranty obligation, could be viewed as an agreement \u201cwhich tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it\u201d (emphasis added) is contrary to the language of the statute: the sale occurred three years before FDIC acquired anything from Banc-Texas, and FDIC acquired nothing from the DEC sale. Further, \u00a7 1823(e)(2), which requires that, to be enforced, such an \u201cagreement\u201d must have been executed \u201ccontemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset\u201d by the bank does not comfortably, to say the least, fit the sale of an asset. It requires no stretch of the meaning of the words \u201casset\u201d or \u201cacquired\u201d to reach this conclusion.\nIf \u00a7 1823(e) does not on its face apply to Sparks\u2019s transaction with DEC, FDIC contends and the district court held that \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) nevertheless applies because the complained-of warranty was an \u201cagreement\u201d that forms the basis of Sparks's \u201cclaim\u201d against FDIC. To repeat, Section 1821(d)(9)(A) states:\n\u201c[A]ny agreement which does not meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 13(e) [12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e) ] shall not form the basis of, or substantially comprise, a claim against the receiver or the Corporation.\u201d\nSeveral issues of statutory interpretation are presented by this contention. First, is \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) different from \u00a7 1823(e)? Second, to what extent does \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) incorporate \u00a7 1823(e)? Third, if \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) has a materially different application than \u00a7 1823(e) to some types of transactions in which a bank engaged before it failed, is it retroactively applicable to those transactions? Because we read \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) as having intended only a modest addition to the scope of \u00a7 1823(e), as a result of which \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) does not apply to Sparks\u2019s deal with DEC, the question of retroactivity becomes not only less important to the statute\u2019s interpretation but irrelevant in this case.\nJuxtaposing \u00a7\u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) and 1823(e), one possible difference is that the former provision bars assertion of certain agreements as affirmative \u201cclaims\u201d against FDIC (and related entities), i.e. as claims for recovery of money or property from the coffers of the insolvent institution, while the older provision bars use of such agreements \u201cagainst\u201d FDIC. Consistent with its origin in the D\u2019Oench case, \u00a7 1823(e) has generally been applied against obligors who have sought to invoke \u201cagreements\u201d that do not conform with the statute as defenses to their duty to repay loans. Section 1823(e) has only recently been used to bar affirmative claims. The earliest of this court\u2019s cases that arguably so held is Beighley v. FDIC, 868 F.2d 776, 783-84 (5th Cir.1989), decided just as Congress completed work on FIRREA. See also, Bell & Murphy & Assoc., Inc. v. Interfirst, 894 F.2d 750 (5th Cir.1990). Consequently, before the enactment of \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A), it was not a foregone conclusion that \u00a7 1823(e) barred the assertion of an affirmative claim against FDIC predicated on an agreement covered by the provision. It could be argued, that \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A), if it has any meaning independent of \u00a7 1823(e), extends the defensive character of \u00a7 1823(e) to bar certain affirmative claims against FDIC.\nThe next question is, to what \u201cagreements\u201d does \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) apply the rigorous \u201crecording\u201d requirements of \u00a7 1823(e)? Put otherwise, is the type of agreement covered by \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) different from that defined by \u00a7 1823(e)? The logical result of FDIC\u2019s argument suggests that \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) is far broader than \u00a7 1823(e). FDIC contends, and the district court agreed, that the bank\u2019s alleged warranty of DEC\u2019s continuous uninterrupted corporate status was an \u201cagreement\u201d that, under \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A), was unenforceable because of its noncompliance with the \u00a7 1823(e) criteria. We have already concluded that the transaction was not covered by \u00a7 1823(e) because it did not embody or was not made in connection with the bank\u2019s \u201cacquisition\u201d of an \u201casset.\u201d Ergo, FDIC\u2019s and the district court\u2019s notion of an agreement under \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) are unconstrained by the portions of \u00a7 1823(e) that refer to the \u201cacquisition\u201d of an \u201casset\u201d by the institution and by FDIC.\nFDIC urges that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Langley compels its broad reading of an \"agreement,\u201d but this is incorrect. Langley held that an agreement under \u00a7 1823(e) could include an oral understanding between borrower and lender that, if enforced, would have constituted a defense to the borrower\u2019s loan repayment obligation. The facts of the case precisely include an \u201casset\u201d of the institution, i.e. the loan, \u201cacquired\u201d by FDIC when the bank failed. Langley did not define or deal with the nature of \u201cassets\u201d to which \u00a7 1823(e) agreements refer. While Langley broadly defines an \u201cagreement\u201d made under \u00a7 1823(e), it does not say that any \u201cagreement\u201d must be unhinged from the rest of the statutory language which contemplates that the \u201cagreement\u201d bear upon an \u201casset\u201d \u201cacquired by\u201d the institution and later by FDIC. The question is not whether Langley\u2019s definition of an \u201cagreement\u201d applies to \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) \u2014 we assume it does \u2014 but instead is whether the modifiers expressly used in \u00a7 1823(e), referencing an agreement in connection with an \u201casset\u201d \u201cacquired\u201d by the institution, are also expressed in \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A). To state the question that way is to answer it. Those modifiers are clearly expressed: among the specific provisions of \u00a7 1823(e) adopted by \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) is the requirement that an enforceable agreement must have been \u201cexecuted by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution.\u201d \u00a7 1823(e)(2) (emphasis added). Again, laying aside the questions of the intended scope of \u201cacquisition\u201d and \u201casset,\u201d there is still no doubt that these terms describe essential features of the transaction to which \u00a7 1823(e), and now \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A), applies. These modifiers bind \u00a7 1823(e) to its origins in the D\u2019Oench doctrine as a device to protect the federal regulators from side agreements that would have impeded the collection of obligations owed to the Bank. Such obligations are the bank\u2019s \u201cassets\u201d acquired in the course of its banking activities.\nMoreover, if \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) were to apply to claims arising from any agreement entered into by a depository institution, absurd consequences would result. A claimant who furnished office supplies to the failed bank could not assert a claim unless his contract was (1) in writing, (2) executed by him and the bank contemporaneously with the sale of office supplies, (3) approved and recorded in the bank\u2019s board of directors\u2019 minutes and (4) continuously maintained as a bank record. Such requirements would render unenforceable the claims of nearly all bank trade creditors. Take another example: if an employee claimed to have been wrongfully denied reimbursement for travel expenses, the \u201cagreement\u201d would, under FDIC\u2019s reasoning, be unenforceable unless it had jumped through the \u00a7 1823(e) hoops. These results transform \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) from a provision protecting the failed bank\u2019s loan portfolio from D\u2019Oench-like secret agreements into a meat-axe for avoiding debts incurred in the ordinary course of business. Far-reaching as some of FIRREA\u2019s provisions were, we doubt that this extravagant extension of \u00a7 1823(e) would have occurred, as it did, unremarked in the legislative history.\nBecause \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) applies to the same type agreements tied to \u201cacquisitions\u201d of \u201cassets\u201d as does \u00a7 1823(e), it cannot apply in this instance to the alleged breach of a warranty by the bank when it sold DEC to Sparks.\nWe note finally that this interpretation of \u00a7 1823(e) and \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) is not necessarily inconsistent with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in North Arkansas Medical Center, supra, because, despite its broad dicta, that ease revolved around loan-related transactions entered into by the bank in its unique capacity as a lending institution. As Justice Scalia noted in Langley the purpose of \u00a7 1823(e) relates to banks in that capacity; to the evaluation of \u201cbank assets\u201d and \u201cmature consideration of unusual loan transactions.\u201d 484 U.S. at 92, 108 S.Ct. at 401. This factor also distinguishes similar cases cited by FDIC.\nCONCLUSION\nSparks may or may not be able to persuade the district court that a warranty of \u201ccontinuous, uninterrupted corporate existence\u201d was an essential contractual feature of his purchase of DEC from BancTexas. If he fulfills this task, he may proceed with his claims against FDIC unhindered by D\u2019Oench, \u00a7 1823(e) or \u00a7 1823(d)(9)(A), because these regulatory superpower rules do not apply to a bank\u2019s sale of an asset in a nonbanking-related transaction. FDIC\u2019s avoidance powers are awesome, but neither infinite nor unrestrained by the statutory language.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.\n. D\u2019Oench Duhme & Co., Inc. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942). The Supreme Court held in D\u2019Oench held a bank customer was estopped from asserting an alleged unrecorded agreement as a defense to an action maintained by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to collect on a note held by an insolvent bank. The alleged agreement between the customer and the bank was intended to protect the customer from collection on the note while deceiving federal banking authorities as to the existence of this asset. See Warren Dennis, The Rise and Expansion of the D\u2019Oench doctrine (American Law Institute, 1992) (available on Westlaw).\n. Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub.L. No. 101-73 103 Stat. 183 ((codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1811 et seq. (1991)). FIRREA significantly overhauled financial institution regulation by the federal government. See generally 1989 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 86 ff.\n. See Plains Machinery Co. v. City of Beaumont, 672 S.W.2d 319, 321 (Tex.App. 9th Dist.1984, no writ) (noting \"a written contract, of course, may be composed of several documents ...\u201d); W.D. Dunavant & Co. v. Southmost Grocers, 561 S.W.2d 578, 582 (Tex.Civ.App. 13th Dist.1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.). See also Jones v. Kelley, 614 S.W.2d 95, 98 (Tex.1981) (noting the general rule in Texas that separate instruments or contracts can be considered as one instrument.)\n. It may be true that the terms \u201casset\u201d and \"acquired\u201d require somewhat broad definitions to render \u00a7 1823(e) efficacious for its intended purposes i.e. to prevent last-minute favoritism by failing banks and to permit FDIC promptly to value a bank\u2019s assets, see Langley v. FDIC, 484 U.S. 86, 108 S.Ct. 396, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987) but those policies are not served here in any event, and even a broad reading of these two terms will not stretch to a bank\u2019s sale of an asset in a non-banking transaction.\n. Section 1821(d)(9)(A) was enacted as part of FIRREA, a complex statute whereby, among other things, the FSLIC was absorbed into the FDIC, receiverships maintained by FSLIC were absorbed into the FDIC, and receiverships maintained by FSLIC were transferred to FDIC. See North Arkansas Medical Center v. Barrett, 962 F.2d 780 (8th Cir.1992). These changes expanded the coverage of \u00a7 1823(e). The pre-FIRREA version of \u00a7 1823(e) protected only FDIC in its corporate capacity, but FIRREA extended that protection to FDIC in its receivership capacity, see, e.g., Texas Refrigeration Supply, Inc. v. FDIC, 953 F.2d 975, 979 (5th Cir.1992); to the RTC, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441a(b)(4); and to bridge banks, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 (n)(4)(I)(i-iv).\n.The legislative history suggests that \u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) was not intended to plow new substantive ground by enhancing FDIC\u2019s avoiding powers. See FIRREA House Rep., 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 128. Like much legislative history, however, the references are obscure and ambiguous.\n. We have parsed the remainder of FIRREA unsuccessfully trying to find a consistent definition of \"claim.\"\n. See Langley v. FDIC, supra, analogizing \u00a7 1823(e) to a recording statute. 484 U.S. at 95, 108 S.Ct. at 403.",
