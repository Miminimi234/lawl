        "text": "Wood, Chief Judge.\nJoshua Van Haften is a Wisconsin native who was\u2019caught travelling to Turkey in \u00e1n attempt to join ISIS,' a designated terrorist organization. In some ways, Van Haften fits the typical profile of a terrorist: he believes that ISIS is fighting a holy war against America\u2014a war that will culminate in the establishment of a global caliphate. But this view is just one strand in a web of bizarre, mystical beliefs Van Haften holds. He also believes, for example, that Britain\u2019s Prince William is--the Antichrist, that people can use numerology to predict the future, and that most Western political leaders are closet Satanists. And Van Haf-ten has a personal vendetta against the United States government that has nothing to do with religion: when he was 18 years old, Van Haften was convicted of statutory rape for having sex with his 15-year-old high school classmate. Van Haf-ten\u2019s status as a sex offender made it difficult for him to live a normal life in America, and he greatly resents the \u201cgodless laws\u201d that, in his view, destroyed his life.\nAfter he was apprehended in Turkey, Van Haften pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B(a)(l). At the sentencing stage, the district court concluded that the terrorism enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4, applies to Van Haften, because his crime was \u201ccalculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A). The enhancement produced an advisory guidelines range of 292-365 months, capped at a 15-year statutory maximum. After hearing testimony about Van Haften\u2019s delusional beliefs and his willingness to reform, the court gave Van Haften a below-guidelines sentence of ten years. Without the terrorism enhancement, Van Haften\u2019s range would have been 57-71 months. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the district court clearly erred in applying the enhancement. We conclude that it did not.\nThe record contains overwhelming evidence that Van Haften sought revenge against the U.S. government. He wrote on Facebook and in various private notes that he despised America because the county \u201cbetrayed\u201d him and Muslims everywhere by refusing to \u201cfollow divinely guided law, otherwise known as Shari\u2019ah.\u201d He described Presidents Obama and Bush as \u201cKuffar disbelievers\u201d and \u201cdefenders of the antichrist,\u201d and said that he wanted to travel to Syria to fight against them and their armies. On one occasion, Van Haften asserted that, once he arrived in the Middle East, he would help ISIS \u201censlave Americans and kill Bush and Obama, [whose] children and grandchildren will be sold as slaves at our markets.\u201d Van Haften also opined that, by placing him on the sex offender registry, the government had \u201cfuck[ed] me for life from age 18.\u201d Because of this, Van Haften said that he wished \u201cdeath to [Americans] and their little children\u201d and proclaimed that he would \u201cshow [them] who [they\u2019re] really fuxkin wit [sic].\u201d\nVan Haften\u2019s writings establish a direct causal link between his hatred of the U.S. government and his desire to \u201cjoin[] my brothers for the war against American liars\u201d and \u201ckill me some American soldier boys.\u201d These statements persuaded the district court that Van Haften sought to join ISIS, at least in part, because he wanted to \u201cretaliate against the government for its treatment of Muslims in general and specifically for its treatment of [Van Haften] as a designated sex offender.\u201d\nIt is true, as defense counsel points out, that Van Haften\u2019s motivations fluctuated over time and that his worldview was not always consistent. In one conversation with his mother, for example, Van Haften described his anti-U.S. rants as mere \u201cvent[ing].\u201d And in a Facebook exchange with a friend, Van Haften wrote that he was travelling to Syria to \u201cbuild roads [and] help the helpless.\u201d Further muddying the waters, Van Haften also \u201cliked\u201d links to stories suggesting that ISIS, rather than being comprised of Islamic holy warriors, was actually a CIA front. The defense highlights these and similar inconsistent statements to argue that Van Haf-ten\u2019s motivations were too incoherent to support a finding that he attempted to join ISIS as \u201ca rational act of retaliation.\u201d Even if this is one way of looking at Van Haften\u2019s behavior, however, it is by no means the only one. Van Haften undoubtedly holds many false beliefs\u2014and the strength with which he has held those beliefs has fluctuated over time\u2014but his actions are not irrational. As the district court saw it, Van Haften\u2019s decision to join ISIS\u2019s war against America was \u201ca rational act of retaliation,\u201d even if the factual predicates that motivated his decision are false or absurd. Put another way, it is unimportant why Van Haften wanted to retaliate against the government. All that matters is that he did, in fact, commit a crime calculated to retaliate against the government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A); United States v. Christianson, 586 F.3d 532, 539 (7th Cir. 2009).\nThe district court did not err, much less clearly err, when it concluded that the record does not support Van Haften\u2019s contention that he wanted to join ISIS solely to \u201chelp the helpless\u201d or to seek shelter from an impending holy war. A desire for safety and Islamic fellowship may have contributed to Van Haften\u2019s decision to travel to Syria, but this innocent desire was not Van Haften\u2019s sole, or even primary, motivation for attempting to join ISIS. The terrorism enhancement applies so long as the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201ccalculated ... to retaliate against government conduct,\u201d even if it was also calculated to accomplish other goals simultaneously. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A); United States v. Wright, 747 F.3d 399, 408 (6th Cir. 2014).\nBecause Van Haften\u2019s own statements demonstrate that he sought to join ISIS to take up arms against America and Americans, we Affirm the decision of the district court to apply the terrorism enhancement to his sentence.",
