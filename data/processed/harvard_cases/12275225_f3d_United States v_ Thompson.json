        "text": "SHEPHERD, Circuit Judge.\nFollowing an August 2016 jury trial, James Thompson was convicted of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Thompson appeals his conviction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nI. Background\nIn July 2015, Sioux Falls police received an anonymous tip that Thompson was distributing controlled substances. While sur-veilling Thompson\u2019s residence, police noticed a garbage container in the dxiveway, located between the garage door and the pedestrian door entrance to the garage. Police then contacted Thompson\u2019s garbage collection service to conduct a controlled trash pull. On a regularly-scheduled day of collection, police watched the garbage collector retrieve Thompson\u2019s garbage container from its location, in Thompson\u2019s driveway by the garage door and dump its contents in the empty collection area of the truck. Police then retrieved the trash from the truck and searched it, finding several drug-related items. The police conducted a similar trash pull the following week, which revealed additional drug-related items and a receipt for a storage unit. Based on. these trash pulls\u2014as well as information received from an informant\u2014 police obtained a search warrant for Thompson\u2019s residence, where they found 19 grams of methamphetamine inside a lockbox, $26,063 in cash hidden inside an ottoman, and drug paraphernalia. Police later obtained a search warrant for Thompson\u2019s storage unit in Luverne, Minnesota, which contained an additional 115.1 grams of methamphetamine and $36,950 in cash.\nPrior to trial, Thompson moved to.suppress all evidence obtained from .the searches, claiming -the warrants were based on unconstitutional trash pulls. Following an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate .judge recommended denying Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress because no trespass occurred or, alternatively, because Thompson did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the trash. The magistrate, judge also found that probable cause \u00e9xisted for the search warrants even absent the information obtained from the trash pulls and, even if'the warrants were invalid, the Leon good faith' exception applied. See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). The district court denied Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in part by agreeing that Thompson did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the trash and that, even without the trash pulls, there was probable cause for the search warrants. Thompson was convicted following a jury trial and sentenced to 150 months imprisonment.\nII. Trash Pulls\nThompson first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. United States v. Farnell, 701 F.3d 256, 260 (8th Cir. 2012). We will \u201caffirm [the] order denying [Thompson\u2019s] motion to suppress unless the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, is based on an erroneous view of the applicable law, or in light of the entire record, we are left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Id. at 260-61 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures .... \u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. A war-rantless search of an individual\u2019s trash violates the Fourth Amendment only where the individual has a \u201csubjective expectation of privacy in [the] garbage that society accepts as objectively reasonable.\u201d California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 85, 39, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988).\nIt is well established that there is no reasonable \u201cexpectation of privacy in trash left for collection in an area accessible to the public.\u201d Id. at 41, 108 S.Ct. 1625. Thompson argues that because the trash was left in a container next to his garage\u2014 rather than on a street curb\u2014the trash was within the curtilage of his home and thus he retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in it. Yet, assuming the trash was within the curtilage of Thompson\u2019s home, \u201cthe proper focus under Greenwood [remains] whether the garbage was readily accessible to the public so as to render any expectation of privacy objectively unreasonable.\u201d United States v. Comeaux, 955 F.2d 586, 589 (8th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe district court found that Thompson\u2019s trash was readily accessible to the public. We agree. The trash was placed in a location from which the garbage collectors regularly collected it at the regularly-scheduled time of collection, suggesting it was placed there \u201cfor the express purpose of having strangers take it.\u201d See Greenwood, 486 U.S. at 40-41, 108 S.Ct. 1625. Presumably, these strangers might \u201csort[ ] through [the] trash or permit[] others, such as the police, to do so.\u201d Id. at 40, 108 S.Ct. 1625. The garbage container was easily visible from the street, and there were no barriers preventing access to the container or its contents. See United States v. Segura-Baltazar, 448 F.3d 1281, 1288 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding no reasonable expectation of privacy in trash containers left next to garage where they were \u201cplainly visible and accessible from the street\u201d); see also United States v. Hedrick, 922 F.2d 396, 400 (7th Cir. 1991) (\u201c[T]he absence of a fence or any other barrier [is one indicator] that the garbage was knowingly exposed to the public\u201d). Based on these facts, we find that Thompson had no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the trash. We therefore conclude that Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.\nIII. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nThompson next claims that the evidence was insufficient to show that he possessed and intended to distribute methamphetamine. \u201cWe review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, viewing evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolving conflicts in the government\u2019s favor, and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the verdict.\u201d United States v. Trejo, 831 F.3d 1090, 1093 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cReversal is appropriate only where a reasonable jury could not have found all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id at 1093-94 (internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find it sufficiently supports Thompson\u2019s conviction.\nTo prove possession with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), the government must show \u201cknowing possession of [methamphetamine] and the intent to distribute it.\u201d United States v. Fetters, 698 F.3d 653, 657 (8th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIntent to distribute controlled substances may be proved by either direct evidence or circumstantial evidence.\u201d United States v. Schubel, 912 F.2d 952, 956 (8th Cir. 1990). \u201cDrug quantity and purity level, drug paraphernalia, prior sales, and the presence of cash or a firearm support an inference of intent to distribute.\u201d Fetters, 698 F.3d at 657.\nHere, police found 19 grams of 98.8% pure methamphetamine in Thompson\u2019s home and 115.1 grams of 98.9% pure methamphetamine in his storage unit. A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent testified that these amounts were consistent with distribution. See United States v. Vega, 676 F.3d 708, 721 (8th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[C]ircumstantial evidence such as drug quantity ... may be used to establish intent to distribute.\u201d). Police also found $26,063 in cash in an ottoman in Thompson\u2019s home and $36,950 in Thompson\u2019s storage unit, as well as digital scales, glass pipes, heat sealed bags, and multiple cell phones. The DEA agent testified that, based on his training and experience, these items were indicative of drug trafficking. See Schubel, 912 F.2d at 956 (\u201cThe presence of equipment to weigh and measure the narcotics, paraphernalia used to aid in their distribution, and large sums of cash are common indicia of drug trafficking and are all circumstantial evidence of intent to distribute.\u201d). Moreover, James Ivy testified that Thompson sold him methamphetamine on multiple occasions. Thompson challenges Ivy\u2019s credibility based on an apparent contradiction in his testimony, but \u201c[wjitness credibility is within the province of the jury and virtually unre-viewable on appeal.\u201d Fetters, 698 F.3d at 657 (internal quotation marks omitted). And, even disregarding this testimony, a reasonable jury could still have determined that Thompson possessed and intended to distribute methamphetamine. We therefore find the evidence sufficient to support Thompson\u2019s conviction.\nIV. Additional Challenges\nIn addition, this Court granted Thompson\u2019s request to file a pro se supplemental brief, wherein he raises ten additional arguments. We have reviewed these challenges and find them to be without merit.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n. Thompson\u2019s residence has a double garage with one garage door, as well as a pedestrian door entrance into the garage located between the garage door and the main entrance of the home. A large driveway sits in front of the home, and a walkway passes in front\u2019 of the pedestrian door of the garage on its way to the main entrance 'of the home. .\n. The Honorable Karen E. Schreier, United States District Judge for' the District of South Dakota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Veronica L. Duffy, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of South Dakota.\n. Included in Thompson\u2019s pro se claims is the contention that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. However, we do not consider such claims on direct appeal except in exceptional circumstances, which are not present here. See United States v. Looking Cloud, 419 F.3d 781, 788-89 (8th Cir. 2005).",
