        "text": "Madsen, J.\nIn 1987, Richard A. Radan (Radan) was convicted of felony first degree theft in the state of Montana. After serving a portion of his sentence, Radan was granted an early discharge from supervision and pursuant to Montana law, all of Radan\u2019s civil rights, including his right to possess firearms, were automatically restored. Subsequently, Radan was charged under RCW 9.41.040 in Pend Oreille County, Washington, with \u201csecond degree felon in possession of a firearm.\u201d\nRadan moved to dismiss, arguing that because his right to possess firearms was fully restored in Montana, he could not be charged under Washington law as a felon in possession of a firearm. The Superior Court granted the motion and the State appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed. State v. Radan, 98 Wn. App. 652, 990 P.2d 962 (1999). Radan petitioned this Court for its review. We reverse.\nFACTS\nThe facts underlying Radan\u2019s Montana conviction are not in dispute. In 1987, Radan was convicted of felony first degree theft. In 1989, Radan\u2019s supervision was transferred to Washington State. In February 1994, Radan\u2019s Washington parole officer recommended, and Radan received, an early discharge from supervision by the State of Montana. As a result of his discharge and in accord with Montana law, Radan\u2019s civil rights, including his right to bear arms, were automatically restored by Montana. Upon his discharge Radan received a form letter from the Washington Department of Corrections stating:\nCongratulations, enclosed is an Order of Discharge signed by the Superior Court.... This Order signifies that you have successfully completed all sentence requirements. The Court has restored your rights to vote and hold public office. You must still contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to apply for restoration of your right to bear firearms.\nPet. for Review, ex. B.\nOn September 4, 1997, two deputy sheriffs were dispatched to Radan\u2019s home in Pend Oreille County. The officers were responding to a report by Radan that there was a prowler on his property. When the officers arrived on the call, Radan was wearing a holster with a handgun. During the course of the investigation, Radan indicated he also possessed a rifle in his home.\nOfficers learned that Radan had a 1987 felony conviction for first degree theft in the state of Montana. Based upon this information a search warrant was obtained and executed for Radan\u2019s residence on September 9, 1997. During the search, two firearms were discovered: a .44 magnum handgun and a 7.65 caliber rifle. In a letter dated September 15, 1997, the Montana Department of Corrections informed the sheriff in Newport that Radan had been \u201csuccessfully discharged from supervision\u201d and that per Montana law his \u201cfull rights [were] restored upon termination of [the] offense . . . .\u201d Pet. for Review, ex. C. The Pend Oreille County prosecutor nevertheless charged Radan by information under RCW 9.41.040(1)(b) with second degree felon in possession of a firearm.\nRadan filed a motion in Superior Court to dismiss. The court granted the motion, finding that because Radan\u2019s civil rights were automatically and fully restored in Montana he could not be prosecuted as a felon in possession of a firearm in Washington. The State appealed and in a published opinion the Court of Appeals (Division Three) reversed, Radan, 98 Wn. App. 652. The court held that because Radan\u2019s civil rights were not restored based on a finding of \u201crehabilitation\u201d or \u201cinnocence,\u201d as required by Washington law, he was still precluded from possessing a firearm in Washington despite Montana\u2019s restoration of his civil rights. Radan petitioned this Court for its review.\nANALYSIS\nRadan does not dispute that Washington may \u201cregulate the possession of firearms within its border.\u201d Resp. Br. at 7. Radan was charged under RCW 9.41.040, which makes it a crime for any person who has \u201cpreviously been convicted in this state or elsewhere of any felony\u201d to possess a firearm. RCW 9.41.040(1)(b)(i). The term \u201cconvicted\u201d includes any instance in which\na plea of guilty has been accepted, or a verdict of guilty has been filed, notwithstanding the pendency of any future proceedings including but not limited to sentencing or disposition, post-trial or post-factfinding motions, and appeals. Conviction includes a dismissal entered after a period of probation, suspension or d\u00e9ferral of sentence, and also includes equivalent dispositions by courts in jurisdictions other than Washington state.\nRCW 9.41.040(3). See also State v. Thomas, 35 Wn. App. 161, 665 P.2d 914 (1983). The predicate offense for the charge against Radan was his 1987 conviction for felony first degree theft in the state of Montana.\nThe principal arguments advanced by Radan in this case center on the fact that, insofar as Montana law is concerned, he has been free to possess firearms since at least 1994. Under Montana law, \u201c[c]onviction of an offense does not deprive the offender of a civil or constitutional right, except as provided in the Montana constitution or as specifically enumerated by the sentencing judge.\u201d Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-801(1). Furthermore, at the time of Radan\u2019s Montana conviction, Montana law provided that \u201c[n]o person shall suffer any civil or constitutional disability not specifically included by the sentencing judge in his order of sentence,\u201d Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-801 Notes, References, and Annotations, 1995 Amend., including the right to bear arms. See United States v. Brooks, 270 Mont. 136, 890 P.2d 759 (1995). Since the Montana sentencing judge\u2019s order is not present in the record, it is not known whether Radan ever lost the right to bear arms in Montana. Nevertheless, even if he did, this right was automatically restored upon his early discharge from supervision in 1994. Article II, section 28 of the Montana Constitution states:\nSection 28. Criminal justice policy \u2014 Rights of the convicted. (1) Laws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on the principles of prevention and reformation. (2) Full rights are restored by termination of state supervision for any offense against the state.\nThe Montana Criminal Code further provides that\n[e]xcept as provided in the Montana constitution, if a person has been deprived of a civil or constitutional right by reason of conviction for an offense and the person\u2019s sentence has expired or the person has been pardoned, the person is restored to all civil rights and full citizenship, the same as if the conviction had not occurred.\nMont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-801(2).\nRCW 9.41.040(3) contains one relevant exception to the bar against an ex-felon possessing a firearm in Washington. It states:\nA person shall not be precluded from possession of a firearm if the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted or the conviction or disposition has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence.\nRCW 9.41.040(3) (emphasis added).\nRadan first argues that Montana\u2019s automatic restoration of his civil rights is an \u201cother equivalent procedure,\u201d thus bringing him within the ambit of RCW 9.41.040(3)\u2019s exception. Resp. Br. at 7. Radan further contends that even if the statute is not clear in this regard, it is nevertheless ambiguous and the rule of lenity should favor his proffered construction. See State v. Lively, 130 Wn.2d 1, 14, 921 P.2d 1035 (1996) (\u201c[t]he rule of lenity provides that where an ambiguous statute has two possible interpretations, the statute is to be strictly construed in favor of the defendant\u201d). On the other hand, the State argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the statute is not ambiguous and that because Radan\u2019s automatic restoration of rights was not based on a \u201cfinding of rehabilitation\u201d or a \u201cfinding of innocence\u201d it cannot qualify as an \u201cother equivalent procedure.\u201d RCW 9.41.040(3).\nIn construing a statute, this Court\u2019s primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. Cherry v. Municipality of Metro. Seattle, 116 Wn.2d 794, 799, 808 P.2d 746 (1991). If a statute is unambiguous this Court is required to apply the statute as written and \u201c \u2018assume [] that the legislature means exactly what it says.\u2019 \u201d In re Custody of Smith, 137 Wn.2d 1, 9, 969 P.2d 21 (1998) (quoting State v. McCraw, 127 Wn.2d 281, 288, 898 P.2d 838 (1995)). The rule of lenity provides that if a criminal statute is ambiguous, it is to be interpreted in favor of the defendant. Lively, 130 Wn.2d at 14. If a statute is unambiguous, however, the rule of lenity is inapplicable. State v. McGee, 122 Wn.2d 783, 787, 864 P.2d 912 (1993); Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 463-64, 111 S. Ct. 1919, 114 L. Ed. 2d 524 (1991).\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that RCW 9.41.040(3) requires something more than an automatic restoration of an individual\u2019s civil rights. Absent a finding of innocence, the statute requires a \u201cpardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted\u201d prior to an ex-felon being restored the right to bear arms. RCW 9.41.040(3). Radan attempts to parse the statute to exclude the explicit requirement that the \u201cother equivalent procedure\u201d be \u201cbased on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted,\u201d Id. Since no such finding is necessary for the automatic restoration of civil rights provided for by Montana law, automatic restoration is insufficient to trigger the exception under RCW 9.41.040(3).\nNor does Radan cite any authority supporting his interpretation. In fact, although neither party, nor the Court of Appeals, has addressed the point, the language used in RCW 9.41.040(3) is identical to the language of ER 609(c), which governs the admissibility of criminal convictions for impeachment purposes. ER 609(c) provides:\nEvidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted ... or (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence.\nER 609(c) (emphasis added).\nThe federal counterpart to this rule, Fed. R. Evid. 609(c), is identical to the Washington rule, and has been interpreted by the federal courts. Given the fact that the wording of this evidence rule and RCW 9.41.040(3) are identical, federal case law interpreting Fed. R. Evid. 609(c) is persuasive in this case.\nFederal courts have consistently reached the conclusion that for a \u201cpardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure\u201d to bar use of a criminal conviction for impeachment purposes there must be an actual finding that the person convicted has been rehabilitated. Zinman v. Black & Decker, Inc., 983 F.2d 431 (2d Cir. 1993). For instance, in Wilson v. Attaway, 757 F.2d 1227 (11th Cir. 1985), the eleventh circuit, in determining whether a conviction under Georgia\u2019s first time offender statute could be used for impeachment, stated:\nThe Georgia First Offender statute, as enacted at time of trial, authorized the court to place on probation a defendant who pleads guilty \u201cwithout entering a judgment of guilt.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-8-60 (1982). Upon fulfillment of the terms of probation, the defendant is discharged. The discharge \u201cshall completely exonerate the defendant of any criminal purpose and shall not affect any of his civil rights or liberties,\u201d and \u201cthe defendant shall not be considered to have a criminal conviction.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-8-62 (1982). Completion of probation without violation \u201cpermits the offender complete rehabilitation without the stigma of a felony conviction.\u201d\nNevertheless, the statute does not provide for rehabilitation within the meaning of Rule 609(c).\nId. at 1244 (citations omitted).\nAccording to the court, Fed. R. Evid. 609(c) \u201creflects \u2018a desire to accord a controlling consideration to rehabilitation as opposed to executive grace or judicial invalidation.\u2019 \u201d Id. The same result was reached in United States v. DiNapoli, 557 F.2d 962 (2d Cir. 1977), where the second circuit held that a \u201cNew York certificate of relief from disabilities ... [is] not a certificate based on a finding either of defendant\u2019s rehabilitation or innocence and therefore was outside the scope of Rule 609(c).\u201d Id. at 966. See also United States v. Wiggins, 566 F.2d 944 (5th Cir. 1978) (release from \u201chalfway house,\u201d where the defendant was placed as a part of probation was not based on a finding of rehabilitation); Biggs v. Nicewonger Co., 897 F. Supp. 483 (D. Or. 1995) (criminal conviction that has been set aside by the State of Oregon may be used to impeach because the set aside was not based on a finding of rehabilitation or innocence).\nA similarly instructive case is United States v. Wood, 943 F.2d 1048 (9th Cir. 1991), which involved the interplay of Montana law and Fed. R. Evid. 609(c). In Wood, the defendant sought to preclude use of several Montana criminal convictions for impeachment purposes. For each of these Montana convictions, the defendant had petitioned a Montana court and been permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas based on a Montana statute. That statute provided:\n\u201cWhenever the court has deferred the imposition of sentence and after termination of the time period during which imposition of sentence has been deferred, upon motion of the court, the defendant, or the defendant\u2019s attorney, the court may allow the defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty or may strike the verdict of guilty from the record and order that the charge or charges against him be dismissed. . . . After the charge is dismissed, all records and data relating to the charge are confidential criminal justice information.\u201d\nId. at 1055 (quoting Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-204).\nEven though the above statute requires judicial discretion, the Wood court held that this was not an \u201cother equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted.\u201d RCW 9.41.040(3). Accordingly, it permitted the use of the expunged convictions for impeachment purposes. Wood, 943 F.2d at 1056. If a statute which places discretion in the court is not an \u201cother equivalent procedure based on a finding of rehabilitation,\u201d then by analogy the Montana provisions that operated to automatically restore Radan\u2019s civil rights cannot be an \u201cother equivalent procedure\u201d either. RCW 9.41.040(3).\nRadan next contends that RCW 9.41.040 should be interpreted in the same manner as its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). This provision criminalizes possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a felony in state or federal court, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922; however, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted, there are critical differences in language between the two statutes. The definitional component of the federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20), provides:\nWhat constitutes a conviction of such crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such pardon, expungment, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (emphasis added).\nUnlike RCW 9.41.040, the federal statute provides an exception for all persons who have had their \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d by the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. See Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 114 S. Ct. 1669, 128 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994) (holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 allows only the convicting jurisdiction to restore civil rights, and finding it immaterial that many states never allow the full restoration of civil rights for convicted felons). Of the federal circuits addressing the question, nearly all have held that this includes the \u201cautomatic\u201d restoration of civil rights provided for by many states, like Montana, upon completion of a criminal sentence. United States v. Hall, 20 F.3d 1066, 1069 (10th Cir. 1994) (\u201cwe join the circuits that view automatic restoration of civil rights as effective under the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exception\u201d); United States v. Thomas, 991 F.2d 206 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Dahms, 938 F.2d 131 (9th Cir. 1991); United States v. Essick, 935 F.2d 28 (4th Cir. 1991); United States v. Cassidy, 899 F.2d 543, 549 (6th Cir. 1990); but see United States v. Caron, 64 F.3d 713, 718 (1st Cir. 1995) (\u201crestoration require [s] individualized, affirmative action signifying that the state has placed renewed trust in the ex-felon\u201d).\nRadan apparently fails to recognize that RCW 9.41.040 does not contain a provision similar to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). Indeed, under Washington law there must be \u201ca pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based\u201d on either \u201ca finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted\u201d or a \u201cfinding of innocence\u201d before an ex-felon may regain the right to possess a firearm. RCW 9.41.040(3). The authority Radan cites is irrelevant in the face of Washington\u2019s statute.\nRadan\u2019s final contention is that this Court should look beyond the automatic restoration of rights conferred by Montana law and look to the specific facts related to his \u201cearly\u201d discharge from supervision. Radan was granted early discharge based upon Montana Code \u00a7 46-23-1011, which states:\n(6)(a) Upon recommendation of the probation and parole officer, a judge may conditionally discharge a probationer from supervision before expiration of the probationer\u2019s sentence if:\n(i) the judge determines that a conditional discharge from supervision:\n(A) is in the best interests of the probationer and society; and\n(B) will not present unreasonable risk of danger to the victim of the offense!.]\nMont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-23-1011. Radan contends that the statutory considerations are equivalent to a finding of rehabilitation. The Court of Appeals disagreed, concluding without the benefit of authority that \u201cthe exemption applies only when it is established that the procedure included a fact-finding inquiry resulting in a finding of the rehabilitation or innocence of the felon.\u201d Radan, 98 Wn. App. at 658. We disagree. Even though RCW 9.41.040 unambiguously requires a \u201cfinding of rehabilitation,\u201d this phrase is undefined. Additionally, the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cother equivalent procedure\u201d suggests the Legislature intended some deference to the practices of other jurisdictions, as long as the practice involved a finding of rehabilitation.\nThe letter from the Montana Department of Corrections recommending Radan\u2019s early discharge indicates that the recommendation was based in part on the following facts: (1) Radan had no new arrests; (2) he had paid his restitution; and (3) he did not wish to return to Montana. However, more important is the fact that the statute authorizing Radan\u2019s early discharge requires a finding that a conditional discharge from supervision is in the best interests of the probationer and society and \u201cwill not present unreasonable risk of danger to the victim of the offense.\u201d Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-23-1011. While we decline to establish a precise definition for the phrase \u201cfinding of rehabilitation\u201d we believe that for purposes of RCW 9.41.040 the finding in Radan\u2019s case is equivalent to an \u201cother equivalent procedure\u201d based upon a \u201cfinding of rehabilitation.\u201d See United States v. Pagan, 721 F.2d 24, 30 (2d Cir. 1983) (\u201ccertificate setting aside a youthful offender\u2019s conviction and unconditionally discharging him from further probation prior to expiration of the maximum term of probation clearly implies a finding that no further supervision is required, i.e., that this offender has been rehabilitated\u201d).\nAccordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal.\nCONCLUSION\nWe hold that Montana\u2019s automatic restoration of civil rights provision does not exempt Radan from charges under RCW 9.41.040. However, Radan\u2019s early discharge from supervision under Montana Code \u00a7 46-23-1011 and the letter of discharge, combined with Montana\u2019s automatic restoration provisions, constitutes an \u201cother equivalent procedure\u201d based on a \u201cfinding of rehabilitation\u201d under RCW 9.41.040(3).\nAlexander, C.J., and Smith, Johnson, and Sanders, JJ., concur.\nRCW 9.41.040 provides for differing levels of severity (first and second degree unlawful possession of a firearm) based on the predicate felony used to establish the offense. See RCW 9.41.040(1)(a), (b). Radan\u2019s Montana conviction was for felony theft and, thus, he was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree.\nRadan could have petitioned a Washington court to have his right to possess firearms restored, and the standard applied by a Washington court would have been far less stringent than that required for conditional discharge from probation under Montana law. RCW 9.41.040(4)(b)(i) provides that a person convicted of a felony may petition to have his right to possess firearms restored \u201cafter five or more consecutive years in the community without being convicted or currently charged with any felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor crimes.\u201d\nDue to our resolution of this issue, we will not address the parties\u2019 additional arguments.",

        "text": "Talmadge, J.\n(dissenting) \u2014 I agree with the majority that RCW 9.41.040(3) requires a \u201cpardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted\u201d before Richard Radan\u2019s right to bear arms in Washington can be restored. I also agree Montana\u2019s statutory restoration of civil rights is essentially automatic and does not satisfy RCW 9.41.040(3). I part company with the majority when it finds Radan\u2019s early discharge from supervision and the automatic restoration of rights by the State of Montana upon the termination of state supervision together constitute a procedure equivalent to a finding of rehabilitation.\nIn enacting RCW 9.41.040(3), the Washington Legislature plainly intended an individualized assessment by an executive branch agency or judicial officer that the felon was absolved of guilt by a pardon or annulment or found to be rehabilitated before that felon\u2019s ability to possess firearms could be restored. The statutory language so states and public safety requires no less. The public interest in denying access to firearms by convicted felons is patent.\nNo individualized assessment of innocence or rehabilitation occurred in Radan\u2019s case. He was not innocent. Moreover, he was not rehabilitated, as that term is understood in Washington. The early discharge letter from Montana\u2019s Department of Corrections stated only that Radan had no new prior arrests, he had paid his restitution, and he did not want to return to Montana. While Montana\u2019s early release statute contemplates such early release may occur only if \u201ca conditional discharge from supervision: (A) is in the best interests of the probationer and society; and (B) will not present unreasonable risk of danger to the victim of the offense,\u201d Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-23-1011 (1999), that is not enough for purposes of RCW 9.41.040(3). There is no individualized finding by the Montana Department of Corrections that Radan is rehabilitated. Indeed, the Montana statute authorizing early release does not require it. A determination that early release is in the best interests of the probationer and the society and a requirement that the felon presents no \u201cunreasonable risk of danger\u201d to his victim is not equivalent to Washington\u2019s requirement of a finding of rehabilitation. Radan simply does not meet the mandate of RCW 9.41.040.\nIronically, if Radan had committed his crimes in Washington, his situation would be entirely different from what the majority now determines to be the law for Montana citizens with criminal histories residing in Washington.\nIn Washington, any felony conviction automatically results in the loss of the right to bear arms, whether or not the judgment so states. RCW 9.41.040(1). The loss of that right continues even after the sentence is served. A felon may possess a firearm \u201cif the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted.\u201d RCW 9.41.040(3) (emphasis added). The Montana procedure under which Radan was discharged from supervision is similar to that applied to Washington defendants convicted under the old indeterminate sentence system. When they completed parole, they were entitled to a certificate of final discharge under RCW 9.96.050. That certificate also served as a restoration of civil rights. But since no finding of rehabilitation was required for the Board to issue that certificate, \u201c[t]his restoration of civil rights shall not restore the right to receive, possess, own, or transport firearms.\u201d RCW 9.96.050; see also 1993 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 10; 1988 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 10; 1969 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 5 (all reaching the same conclusion prior to the clarifying amendment to RCW 9.96.050).\nHad Radan\u2019s theft conviction been entered in Washington, he would immediately have lost his right to bear arms, and the automatic restoration of civil rights upon completion of probation or parole would not permit him to possess firearms. He could petition the court to have his right to possess firearms restored, RCW 9.41.040(4). But until that relief were granted, possession would be unlawful under RCW 9.41.040(1).\nThe majority distorts the plain language of RCW 9.41.040 to restore the ability of a Montana felon to possess firearms in Washington. The Court of Appeals decision in this case was entirely correct. I would reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting Radan\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nIreland and Bridge, JJ., and Guy, J. Pro Tern., concur with Talmadge, J. Pro Tern.\nJustice Philip Talmadge is serving as a justice pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Const. art. IV, \u00a7 2(a).\nThe Court of Appeals below correctly noted the statutory language requiring a \u201cfinding of innocence\u201d or a \u201cfinding of... rehabilitation,\u201d RCW 9.41.040(3), when it stated: \u201cIndeed, the statutory exemption applies only when it is established that the procedure included a fact-finding inquiry resulting in a finding of the rehabilitation or innocence of the felon in question.\u201d State v. Radan, 98 Wn. App. 652, 658, 990 P.2d 962 (1999). The use of the term \u201cfinding\u201d implies an individualized assessment.\nInitiative 159 (Hard Time for Armed Crime) states: \u201cCurrent law does not sufficiently stigmatize the carrying and use of deadly weapons by criminals, and far too often there are no deadly weapon enhancements provided for many felonies, including murder, arson, manslaughter, and child molestation and many other sex offenses including child luring.\u201d Codified in Laws or 1995, ch. 129, \u00a7 1(c). Declining to easily restore the right to possess firearms to convicted felons is such a stigmatization.",
