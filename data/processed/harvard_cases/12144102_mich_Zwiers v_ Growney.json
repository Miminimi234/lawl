See Furr v McLeod, 498 Mich 68 (2015). A medical malpractice complaint filed before the expiration of the 182-day notice period is ineffective to toll the statute of limitations. We remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issues raised by the plaintiff but not addressed by that court during its initial review of this case.",
