        "text": "SCHROEDER, Circuit Judge:\nThe claimant appeals from an order of the district court denying attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), on the ground that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified. On appeal, the government raises for the first time a jurisdictional issue. It argues that as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Melkonyan v. Sullivan, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991), decided after the district court\u2019s order, the application for fees in the district court was untimely, barring the court from jurisdiction.\nThe procedural history of this case is important to the resolution of this jurisdictional issue. The claimant, Edward E. Gray, applied for disability benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq., in August of 1985. An Administrative Law Judge denied the application. The claimant then filed an action in district court seeking review of the denial of disability benefits. The district court affirmed in March of 1988. Gray then successfully appealed to this court, which held, in a divided, unpublished decision, that the Secretary had committed legal errors in reviewing the claimant\u2019s application. Gray v. Secretary of HHS, 874 F.2d 816 (9th Cir.1989). Our mandate instructed the district court to remand to the AU for reconsideration and entry of findings in accordance with our disposition. The district court complied with that mandate and remanded to the AU on June 30, 1989.\nOn remand, the AU found that the claimant was entitled to benefits and entered an order on March 6,1990, which was not appealed by the government. Within 30 days of the entry of that order, the claimant filed an application for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA in the district court. The district court denied the application on the merits on February 22, 1991, holding that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified because at the time of the original administrative proceeding, the law in that area was unsettled. The district court also pointed out that this court\u2019s lack of unanimity in ordering the remand supported a finding that the government\u2019s position was reasonable.\nAt the time that the claimant filed his application for attorney\u2019s fees in the district court, the leading Supreme Court decision on the application of the EAJA to disability claims was Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U.S. 877, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 104 L.Ed.2d 941 (1989). The issue in that case was whether attorney\u2019s fees are available for representation in agency proceedings following a remand by a district court. The Supreme Court held that such fees are available, provided the other requirements of the Act are met, even though the fees were earned in the course of administrative, not judicial, proceedings. In so holding, the Court stressed the unusual character of section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Act\u2019s \u201cdetailed provisions\u201d suggest \u201ca degree of direct interaction between a federal court and an administrative agency alien to traditional review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d Hudson, 490 U.S. at 885, 109 S.Ct. at 2254. The Court summarized its holding as follows:\nWe conclude that where a court orders a remand to the Secretary in a benefits litigation and retains continuing jurisdiction over the case pending a decision from the Secretary which will determine the claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits, the proceedings on remand are an integral part of the \u201ccivil action\u201d for judicial review and thus attorney\u2019s fees for representation on remand are available subject to the other limitations in the EAJA.\nId. at 892, 109 S.Ct. at 2257-58.\nThe remand in Hudson, as well as the remand in this case, was pursuant to sentence four of \u00a7 405(g), which states that \u201c[t]he court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Supreme Court in Hudson recognized that the district court remand order could not constitute a final judgment because the administrative procedures on remand were \u201cpart and parcel\" of the lawsuit, indispensable to determining whether or not the claimant ultimately would be a prevailing party and qualify for fees under the EAJA. Hudson, 490 U.S. at 887-888, 109 S.Ct. at 2255-56. In addition, if the government\u2019s position denying fees for administrative proceedings were upheld, the EAJA would become a \u201clifeline\u201d that was \u201ca foot short,\u201d a result contrary to congressional intent. Id. at 890, 109 S.Ct. at 2256.\nIn June of 1991, two months before the government\u2019s brief in this appeal was filed, the Supreme Court decided Melkonyan v. Sullivan, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991). The government in this case argues for the first time on appeal that, under Melkonyan, the district court lacked jurisdiction of this claimant\u2019s petition for fees under the EAJA. It argues that the district court\u2019s 1989 remand to the ALJ, pursuant to our original mandate, was the final judgment triggering the 30-day time period for filing a fee application. At first blush, this argument is difficult to understand because, if accepted, it would require the applicant to apply for fees before the applicant could qualify as a prevailing party, and thus would prevent claimants like this one, and the claimant in Hudson, from ever qualifying for fees under the EAJA. This argument runs directly contrary to the EAJA\u2019s purpose that litigants not \u201cbe deterred from seeking review of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights.\u201d Hudson, 490 U.S. at 883, 109 S.Ct. at 2253. As the Court in Hudson pointed out, \u201cthe incentive which such a system would create for attorneys to abandon claimants after judicial remand runs directly counter to long established ethical canons of the legal profession.\u201d Hudson, 490 U.S. at 890, 109 S.Ct. at 2256. We find that the government has misinterpreted Melkonyan, and that the district court had jurisdiction over Gray\u2019s application.\nIn Melkonyan, the Supreme Court did not leave a Social Security applicant without a meaningful opportunity to apply for fees. Melkonyan appealed his denial of benefits to the district court, which remanded to the AU for consideration of new evidence. The ALJ awarded benefits to Melkonyan. One year later, the claimant filed for attorney\u2019s fees in the district court. This circuit held that the administrative agency\u2019s determination was the final judgment, and that therefore Melko-nyan\u2019s application was not timely filed. The Supreme Court reversed, finding that \u00a7 2412 of the EAJA requires a final judgment by a court of law, not by an administrative agency. The Supreme Court remanded to determine if the district court\u2019s remand was a sentence six remand under \u00a7 405(g). A sentence six remand directs the Secretary to receive additional evidence upon a showing of good cause for failure to incorporate the evidence in a prior proceeding. Sentence six remands require the Secretary to return to the district court for an entry of final judgment. If the district court in Melkonyan did in fact enter a sentence six remand, then Melkonyan\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee application was not untimely.\nThe language in Melkonyan which gives rise to the government\u2019s jurisdictional challenge in this case is language which suggests that in a sentence four remand, the district court order of remand is itself the final judgment for purposes of the EAJA. The Court\u2019s opinion in Melkonyan states that: \u201c[i]n sentence four cases, the filing period begins after the final judgment (\u2018affirming, modifying, or reversing\u2019) is entered by the court and the appeal period has run, so that the judgment is no longer appealable.\u201d Id. \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2165. The government argues that under this definition, the district court\u2019s final judgment was the remand to the AU on June 30, 1989, pursuant to our appellate mandate.\nIn reacting to this tension between the language in Melkonyan and the holding in Hudson, the circuits have proposed numerous interpretations which avoid the jurisdictional barrier the government here seeks. One approach has been for the courts to find that there are some sentence four remands in which the district court retains jurisdiction until after the administrative decision on remand. See Labrie v. Secretary of HHS, 976 F.2d 779 (1st Cir.1992); Hafner v. Sullivan, 972 F.2d 249 (8th Cir.1992); Gutierrez v. Sullivan, 953 F.2d 579 (10th Cir.1992), petition for cert. filed, 61 U.S.L.W. 3171 (U.S. Aug. 26, 1992) (No. 92-361); Welter v. Sullivan, 941 F.2d 674 (8th Cir.1991). A second approach has been to define an order that vacates and remands for further proceedings as a sentence six remand, which requires a return to the district court. See Young v. Sullivan, 972 F.2d 830 (7th Cir.1992); Damato v. Sullivan, 945 F.2d 982 (7th Cir.1991). A third approach, offered by an unpublished Fourth Circuit opinion, applies Melkonyan on a prospective basis only, and is discussed in Labrie, 976 F.2d at 784. One Fifth Circuit opinion found that a 30-day requirement under Melkonyan applied, but used its equitable discretion to allow consideration of the application, in order to avoid unfairness to the applicant. See Luna v. Department of HHS, 948 F.2d 169, 173 (5th Cir.1991) (plaintiff is entitled to \u201cequitable tolling\u201d of the 30-day time limit because the district court \u201cpurported to retain jurisdiction, thus unwittingly misleading [the plaintiff] to think that no final judgment was being entered.\u201d). Since Luna, the Fifth Circuit has held that a fee application in the district court is premature at the time of a sentence four remand to the agency if there is not yet an award, and therefore a prevailing party, in the agency proceedings. Bertrand v. Sullivan, 976 F.2d 977, 979 (5th Cir.1992).\nIn this circuit\u2019s only post-Melkonyan opinion, Scanlon v. Sullivan, 974 F.2d 107 (9th Cir.1992), the district court had remanded Scanlon\u2019s suit for disability benefits for additional proceedings and findings in an order that explicitly required the Secretary to file the new findings and the new judgment with the district court. On remand, Scanlon was found eligible for disability benefits. Neither Scanlon nor the Secretary returned to the district court for entry of a final judgment. Scanlon applied for fees. The Secretary argued that under Melkonyan, the district court\u2019s remand order was a final judgment. Without any analysis of Melkonyan, we found that \u201c[t]he words used by the district court belie such an interpretation.\" Id. at 108. We held that the district court did not yet have jurisdiction over the claimant\u2019s EAJA petition for attorney\u2019s fees because the Secretary had not returned to the court upon completion of the remand proceedings. Since no final judgment was entered, the district court did not yet have jurisdiction. The First Circuit has described our decision in Scanlon as an implicit adoption of the First, Eighth and Tenth Circuits\u2019 broad interpretation of sentence four remands to include retention of district court jurisdiction until after the administrative hearings. Labrie, 976 F.2d at 784 n. 9.\nIn line with our decision in Scan-lon and consistent with the decisions of other circuits, we must endeavor to harmonize the decision in Melkonyan with the decision in Hudson; Melkonyan did not overrule Hudson, but stated that its holding was consistent with Hudson. \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2162. Such reconciliation of the two decisions is not difficult in this case. Here, all administrative proceedings on remand and attorney\u2019s fee litigation in the district court were conducted after Hudson was decided. Those proceedings were therefore conducted with the understanding that the district court retained jurisdiction in the case and that the remand order was not a final judgment divesting it of any jurisdiction to consider either the findings of the Secretary on remand or the availability of fees. Melkonyan was decided after the district court entered its order denying fees, and was not a sentence four case; it should not affect the district court's jurisdiction over this sentence four remand. We join the First, Eighth and Tenth Circuits in concluding that Hudson is controlling in these cases. We agree that:\n[WJhen a judicial remand order in Social Security disability cases contemplates additional administrative proceedings that will determine the merits of the claimant\u2019s application for benefits, and thus will determine whether the claimant is a prevailing party, the district court retains discretion to enter a final judgment for EAJA purposes after the proceedings on remand have been completed. On the other hand, if the remand order directs the Secretary to award benefits, the claimant is a prevailing party and the remand order is the final judgment for EAJA purposes.\nLabrie, 976 F.2d at 786 (quoting Hafner, 972 F.2d at 250-51). We agree that the district court retained such jurisdiction during a remand ordered prior to Melkonyan, at least in the absence of an express intent to the contrary. Id. We therefore conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s fee application.\nOn the merits, however, we agree with the district court that the fee application was properly denied. From our analysis of this case, it is clear that the appellant raises no serious issue on the merits with respect to the district court\u2019s order. The government\u2019s position was substantially justified. The evidence in the administrative record was conflicting and a panel majority remanded for additional findings. It did not hold that appellant must prevail, and the dissenting judge believed he should not have. See Gray v. Secretary of HHS, 874 F.2d 816 (9th Cir.1989). The decision upon which the majority relied had not been handed down when the government established its position. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s application.\nAFFIRMED.\n. The relevant provision of the EAJA is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), which provides in relevant part:\n(1)(B) A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses are computed. The party shall also allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified. Whether or not the position of the United States was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based) which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.\n. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) provides in relevant part:\nAny individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow.\n[Sentence four]\nThe court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\n[Sentence six]\nThe court may, on motion of the Secretary made for good cause shown before he files his answer, remand the case to the Secretary for further action by the Secretary, and it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Secretary, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding; and the Secretary shall, after the case is remanded, and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirm his findings of fact or his decision, or both, and shall file with the court any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and a transcript of the additional record and testimony upon which his action in modifying or affirming was based.",

        "text": "BEEZER, Circuit Judge,\ndissenting:\nI am compelled to apply United States Supreme Court precedent concerning the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain an application for Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) attorney fees. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. The Supreme Court quite clearly explains the jurisdictional framework surrounding SSI disability benefit attorney fee applications. Melkonyan v. Sullivan, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991). Because I conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Gray\u2019s application, I would vacate the district court\u2019s order denying fees and remand for dismissal of Gray\u2019s application.\nI\nA district court\u2019s jurisdiction over an SSI attorney fee application depends on the finality of the order the court files in the merits action. The Supreme Court identifies three routes by which an SSI disability benefits case can return to the Secretary after judicial review has been sought. First, a district court may affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (a \u201csentence four\u201d remand). Second, a district court may forgo a substantive ruling and remand for the taking of additional evidence, for good cause shown. Id. (a \u201csentence six\u201d remand). Section 405(g) authorizes only these two types of remands. Melkonyan, \u2014 U.S. at ---, 111 S.Ct. at 2164-65. Third, the parties may stipulate to a remand. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a) (voluntary dismissal). See generally Mel-konyan, \u2014 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 2163-65 (discussing three possible routes).\nThe procedure by which a case returns to the Secretary determines finality for purposes of the EAJA, and thus prescribes the time frame within which an application for attorney fees must be filed:\nIn sentence four cases, the filing period begins after the final judgment (\u201caffirming, modifying, or reversing\u201d) is entered by the court and the appeal period has run, so that the judgment is no longer appealable. See \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(G). In sentence six cases, the filing period does not begin until after the postremand proceedings are completed, the Secretary returns to court, the court enters a final judgment, and the appeal period runs....\n... [I]f the court\u2019s order was, in effect, a dismissal under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 41(a), the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the case would have ended at that point, and petitioner would not have been a prevailing party \u201cin [a] civil action.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2413(d)(1)(A). Under those circumstances, the Secretary would not return to the District Court and petitioner would not be eligible to receive EAJA fees.\nId. \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2165.\nThis circuit has already embarked on fleshing out the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Melkonyan. In Scanlon v. Sullivan, 974 F.2d 107 (9th Cir.1992), we considered a case in which\n[t]he parties stipulated to the entry of the tentative decision, and the district court\u2019s order remanding the case was entered on July 7, 1988. The court ordered that \u201cafter the case is remanded and after such additional administrative proceedings as are required are completed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall modify or affirm the findings of fact or the decision, or both, and shall file with this Court any such additional or modified findings of fact and decision, and proposed judgment for entry.\u201d\nId. at 108. The Secretary found in Scan-lon\u2019s favor; neither Scanlon nor the Secretary ever returned to the district court. Id.\nBecause the issue had not been presented to the district court, we declined to consider whether Melkonyan would render the district court\u2019s order a final judgment. We held, however, that the absence of a final judgment precluded the district court from considering Scanlon\u2019s fee petition. Id. at 108. For us to conclude that the district court had not rendered a final judgment, its action must have been either a sentence six remand or a voluntary dismissal. By not finding a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d supporting remand, see Melkonyan, \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2164, the district court must have \u201ctreated the joint request for remand as a voluntary dismissal.\u201d Id. \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2165. Hence our holding: \u201cin the absence of a final judgment, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Scanlon\u2019s fee petition.\u201d Scanlon, 974 F.2d at 108.\nII\nA party seeking an award of attorney fees under the EAJA \u201cshall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2413(d)(1)(B). A \u201c \u2018final judgment\u2019 means a judgment that is final and not appealable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(G). A final judgment under \u00a7 2412 must be entered by a court of law, not an administrative agency. Melkonyan, \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2161 (noting that \u00a7 2412 addresses a \u201cfinal judgment in the action,\u201d whereas 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 addresses a \u201cfinal disposition in the adversary adjudication\u201d).\nI further note the distinction that under \u00a7 2412 a party applies to the court for an award of fees, whereas under \u00a7 504 a party applies to the agency. Compare 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(2). When a matter becomes final, under either statute, a party has thirty days to seek, with the relevant adjudicative body, attorney fees that pertain to the proceedings conducted before it. Gray seeks attorney fees under \u00a7 2412, so we look to the proceedings conducted before a court.\nThe Secretary initially denied Gray\u2019s petition for disability benefits. Gray appealed to the district court, which affirmed the Secretary\u2019s determination. Gray appealed the district court\u2019s judgment to us, and we reversed, directing that the Secretary reconsider his determination using correct legal standards. Gray v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 874 F.2d 816 (9th Cir.1989). Procedurally, however, our mandate issued to the district court, which then remanded the matter to the Secretary. See Bunnell v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 341, 348 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc). On June 6, 1989, the district court remanded to the Secretary after a reversal of his decision, a sentence four remand. See Melkonyan, \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2163.\n\u201cIn sentence four cases, the filing period begins after the final judgment (\u2018affirming, modifying, or reversing\u2019) is entered by the court and the appeal period has run, so that the judgment is no longer appealable.\u201d Id. \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2165. Our final judgment in Gray\u2019s merits appeal was filed April 21, 1989. The Secretary had ninety days to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. Sup.Ct. Rs. 11, 12. \u201cThe 30-day EAJA clock beg[an] to run after the time to appeal that \u2018final judgment\u2019 [] expired.\u201d Melkonyan, \u2014 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 2162. Without quibbling over the niceties of counting days, I can safely say that March 19, 1990 is more than 120 days after April 21, 1989.\nFinally, I would hold that the thirty day time period within which Gray had to seek attorney fees is jurisdictional. See Scanlon, 974 F.2d at 108; cf. Columbia Mfg. Corp. v. NLRB, 715 F.2d 1409, 1410 (9th Cir.1983) (thirty day EAJA filing period for adversary adjudications is jurisdictional). The fee statutes are intimately bound up with the finality of judgments and the time periods within which a party must file a notice of appeal. Such time periods are jurisdictional. Rodgers v. Watt, 722 F.2d 456, 457-58 (9th Cir.1983) (en banc).\nBecause Gray did not timely appeal for attorney fees with the district court, the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the application. I would vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Gray\u2019s fee application and remand with instructions to dismiss the application.\nI respectfully dissent.\n. In Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a remand order for rehearing under the fourth sentence of \u00a7 405(g) was a final judgment subject to immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Such final judgment \"terminated the civil action\u201d that challenged the initial denial of benefits.\n. On March 6, 1990, an administrative law judge granted Gray\u2019s petition for disability benefits, terminating his merits proceedings. Gray applied for attorney fees in the district court on March 19, 1990. The district court denied Gray's application on February 19, 1991. He timely appealed.",
