        "text": "REAVLEY, Circuit Judge:\nIn this suit to collect alleged transportation undercharges, Empire Tubulars, Inc. (Empire) appeals summary judgment in favor of Thrasher Trucking Co. (Thrasher). We affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThrasher engages in both contract and common motor carriage, as well as the brokerage of carrier service, in interstate commerce. After negotiating, billing, and collecting a rate lower than that which it had on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), Thrasher sued Empire to collect alleged transportation undercharges. Empire responded that Thrasher had merely brokered out Empire\u2019s transportation requirements, and should not be allowed to recover the difference between its filed rate and actual rates charged because Thrasher did not actually perform the transportation services contracted and paid for.\nThe district court granted summary^ judgment in Thrasher\u2019s favor. Empire appeals, arguing that (1) Thrasher performed its transportation services pursuant to a contract with Empire, and thus was a \u201ccontract carrier\u201d and not a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d with respect to Empire, and (2) even if Thrasher was operating as a common carrier with respect to Empire, since Thrasher was not the actual carrier of the goods, its filed rate was not \u201capplicable and reasonable\u201d to goods which it did not actually carry.\nII. ANALYSIS\nThe Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 et seq., provides three distinct types of status: \u201cbroker,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(1), \u201cmotor common carrier,\u201d id. \u00a7 10102(14), and \u201cmotor contract carrier,\u201d id. \u00a7 10102(15). It is undisputed that Thrasher is empowered to act in any of these three capacities.\nA. Broker vs. Carrier.\nA broker \u201cfor compensation, arranges, or offers to arrange, the transportation of property by an authorized motor carrier.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1045.2(a). Empire contends that Thrasher \u201cbrokered\u201d much of the transportation services which it agreed to provide for Empire; and, therefore, that the transportation services provided should be billed at the rates of the \u201cactual\u201d carriers (as if Thrasher were a \u201cbroker\u201d), rather than at Thrasher\u2019s rates. While this argument is intuitively appealing, it squarely contradicts existing law. Section 1045.2(a) continues:\nMotor carriers ... are not brokers within the meaning of this section when they arrange or offer to arrange the transportation of shipments which they are authorized to transport and which they have accepted and legally bound themselves to transport.\nId. (emphasis added).\nNo one disputes that Thrasher was \u201cauthorized\u201d to transport Empire\u2019s property. And, if we accept Empire\u2019s argument that Thrasher agreed to provide the disputed services, then Thrasher \u201caccepted and legally bound themselves\u201d to transport Empire\u2019s property. Therefore, Thrasher was not acting as a \u201cbroker,\u201d as that term is contemplated by the ICA or the ICC.\nB. Common Carrier vs. Contract Carrier.\nIf Thrasher was not acting as a \u201cbroker\u201d for purposes of the ICA, then it must have been acting pursuant to its \u201cmotor carrier\u201d authority.\n1.Car\u00f1er Status.\nA motor carrier acts either as a \u201cmotor common carrier\u201d or a \u201cmotor contract carrier.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(13). A motor common carrier \u201chold[s] itself out to the general public to provide motor vehicle transportation for compensation over regular or irregular routes, or both.\u201d Id. \u00a7 10102(14). A motor contract carrier, inter alia, \u201cprovid[es] motor vehicle transportation of property for compensation under continuing agreements with one or more persons.\u201d Id. \u00a7 10102(15)(B).\n2. Carrier Rates.\nThe ICA requires a motor common carrier to publish its rate(s) in a tariff filed with the ICC. Id. \u00a7 10762(a)(1). Generally speaking, that filed rate \u201cgoverns the legal relationship between shipper and carrier,\u201d Maislin Indus., U.S. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 126, 110 S.Ct. 2759, 2765, 111 L.Ed.2d 94 (1990), such that the filed rate is the \u201clegal rate[ ] ... which must be charged to all shippers alike.\u201d Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S.F. R.R., 284 U.S. 370, 384, 52 S.Ct. 183, 184, 76 L.Ed. 348 (1932) (emphasis added). However, if Thrasher carried Empire\u2019s goods pursuant to its \u201cmotor contract carrier\u201d authority, then the appropriate rate would be the contract rate agreed to by Thrasher and Empire, notwithstanding Thrasher\u2019s simultaneous status as a \u201cmotor common carrier.\u201d Atlantis Express, Inc. v. Standard Transp. Serv., 955 F.2d 529, 533 (8th Cir.1992); Exemption of Motor Contract Carriers from Tariff Filing Requirements, 133 M.C.C. 150 (1983), aff'd sub nom. Central & S. Motor Freight Tariff Ass\u2019n v. United States, 757 F.2d 301 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1019, 106 S.Ct. 568, 88 L.Ed.2d 553 (1985).\n3. Thrasher\u2019s Status.\nCurrent ICC regulations require:\nNo contract carrier by motor vehicle, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 10102(15)[,] shall transport property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce except under special and individual contracts or agreements which shall be in writing, shall provide for transportation for a particular shipper or shippers, shall be bilateral and impose specific obligations upon both carrier and shipper or shippers, shall cover a series of shipments during a stated period of time in contrast to contracts of carnage governing individual shipments, and copies of which contracts or agreements shall be preserved by the carriers parties thereto so long as such contracts or agreements are in force and for at least one year thereafter.\n49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1053.1 (emphases added). Thrasher argues that, since Empire has not presented any evidence of a written contract complying with this regulation, Empire cannot legally argue that Thrasher was acting as a \u201cmotor contract carrier.\u201d Furthermore, the second italicized passage negates Empire\u2019s alternative argument that each bill of lading comprised a contract for carriage within the contemplation of the ICA.\nEmpire refers us to Atlantis Express, Inc. v. Standard Transportation Services, Inc., 955 F.2d 529 (8th Cir.1992), which reversed and remanded a summary judgment in favor of the carrier, entered by the district court because the shipper did not produce a written contract, and referred the matter to the ICC. The Eighth Circuit apparently based its decision on the ICC\u2019s recent statement that \u201cit is not [ICC\u2019s] policy to find a lack of contract carriage based on simple, technical oversights or omissions,\u201d id. at 533 (quoting ICC, Ex Parte No. MC-198, Contracts for Transportation of Property 5 (Feb. 28, 1991)), notwithstanding numerous \u201cpast ICC decisions that have consistently required a written contract\u201d in order to find that contract carriage exited. Id. at 534.\nWith all due deference to the Eighth Circuit, we do not agree that the complete lack of a written contract constitutes a \u201csimple, technical oversight ] or omission[ ].\u201d Current ICC regulations require a written contract, of prescribed form and content, in order to operate as a \u201cmotor contract carrier.\u201d To resist the motion for summary judgment, Empire was required to present evidence that the carriage at issue was made pursuant to a contract of that form and content. To the contrary, Empire (1) produced no such contract and (2) stated by sworn response to interrogatory that no known documents were lost or destroyed.\nSince Empire failed to present evidence to raise an issue of carriage under a written contract meeting ICC regulations, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Thrasher was acting as an authorized \u201cmotor common carrier\u201d when it performed transportation services for Empire between July 1987 and January 1988. And, since \u201c[i]gnorance or misquotation of rates is not an excuse for paying or charging either less or more than the rate filed,\u201d Maislin, 497 U.S. at 127, 110 S.Ct. at 2766 (quoting Louisville & N. R.R. v. Maxwell, 237 U.S. 94, 97, 35 S.Ct. 494, 495, 59 L.Ed. 853 (1915)), we find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling that Empire is obligated to pay Thrasher the difference between Thrasher\u2019s filed rate(s) applicable to the various shipments which are the subject of this action and the amount Empire has already paid Thrasher for those shipments.\nAFFIRMED.",
