Henry Chamberlin, Impleaded, etc., Respondent.\n(Argued March 13, 1882;\ndecided March 21, 1882.)\nThis was an action to foreclose a mortgage.\nDefendant Chamberlain, who purchased the premises subsequent to the execntion of the mortgage, was sought to be held liable for a deficiency because of a clause in his deed assuming and agreeing to pay the mortgage. It appeared that \u2022 said clause was inserted without the knowledge and contrary to the intention of the parties to the deed, and was not at any time accepted or assented to by Chamberlain, and he only became aware of its existence after the commencement of the suit. ' Held, that Chamberlain was not liable, the court citing Kilmer v. Smith (77 NT. Y. 226); Albany City S\u2019v\u2019gs Instfn v. Burdick (87 id. 40).\nI. F. Williams for appellant.\nStephen G. Glarrke for respondent."
