      {
        "text": "Reversed and remanded by published opinion. Judge WILKINSON wrote the opinion, in which Judge KING and Judge WYNN joined. Judge KING wrote a separate concurring opinion.\nWILKINSON, Circuit Judge:\nThe day after his twentieth birthday, Faisal Hashime was convicted of multiple counts related to child pornography and later sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Hashime made numerous self-incriminating statements while being interrogated by law-enforcement agents during a search of his home. Because the agents did not read Hashime his Miranda rights until well into what was plainly an extended custodial interrogation, we reverse Hash-ime\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\nI.\nA.\nIn November 2010, while monitoring a website used to exchange child pornography, a law-enforcement agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations unit (HSI) discovered a naked picture of a minor boy with the caption \u201cEmail me, t. campbell2011@gmail.com.\u201d In July 2011, the agent sent an email to the t.campbell 2011@gmail.com address, asking to trade child-pornography images. The agent eventually received twenty-four explicit pictures of a naked boy. By tracing the email account\u2019s associated IP address, HSI concluded that the account was being used by someone in the Hashime family home.\nBased on this information, law enforcement obtained and executed search warrants on both the t.eampbell2011@gmail. com email account and Hashime\u2019s house. Shortly after 9:00 AM on May 18, 2012, a team of 15-30 state and federal law-enforcement agents equipped with a battering ram descended on Hashime\u2019s home. Hashime, at the time a 19-year-old community-college student, lived with his parents in suburban northern Virginia. The agents banged on the entrance, yelling \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\nAfter being let in by Hashime\u2019s aunt, the officers streamed into the house with their guns drawn. An officer entered Hash-ime\u2019s bedroom and pointed a gun at him. Hashime was in bed, naked and asleep, having gone to bed at 5 AM that morning. The officer ordered Hashime to \u201cGet up.... Get out of bed,\u201d and instructed Hashime to show his hands. After Hash-ime put on boxer shorts, the officer held Hashime by the arm, issuing orders to him, and marched him out to the front lawn, where officers were corralling the other members of his family. Despite the chilly weather, the Hashime family members were kept outside, several of them dressed only in their nightclothes.\nWhen law enforcement eventually allowed Hashime and his family back into their house, they were kept in the living room while the officers completed their sweep of the home. Hashime was not allowed to go to the bathroom until the officers had \u201cclear[ed] it out.\u201d Hashime was given his clothes but was not provided with shoes or socks. Hashime\u2019s mother, who was recovering from recent brain surgery, and about whose health Hashime was concerned, asked to lie down for health reasons but was not allowed to. The Hashime family members were not permitted to be alone and were instructed that they had to be accompanied by officers at all times. The law-enforcement agents proceeded to interrogate each of them individually.\nHashime was escorted by two officers to the basement for interrogation. The basement was finished, but the officers chose to interrogate Hashime in a room that was being used as a storage area. Hashime\u2019s family was not allowed to see Hashime until the three-hour interrogation was over. Hashime\u2019s mother asked the officers three times for an attorney for Hash-ime, but was told that he was being questioned and that she could not see him or otherwise interrupt the interrogation. According to Hashime\u2019s mother, the officers told her that Hashime was under arrest.\nThe officers secretly recorded the interrogation. When Hashime asked them if they were recording it, the lead interrogator, who was not carrying the recording device, told Hashime, \u201cI can tell you I don\u2019t have a recorder on----\u201d During the interrogation, Hashime admitted to having child pornography on his computer and told the officers in great detail about how he had obtained the photographs. Hash-ime also gave the officers the password to his computer and told them where the child-pornography images were located on his hard drive.\nAt the beginning of the interview, the officers told Hashime that he did not have to answer their questions and could leave at any time. However, at one point in the interrogation, one of the officers told Hashime, \u201cI need to know, and I need you to be completely honest with me here even if you\u2019re afraid, I don\u2019t care if you say I don\u2019t want to answer that or I\u2019m afraid to answer it, but I need to know the truth.\u201d JA 585. In addition, when one of the interrogators left Hashime to go upstairs, he told Hashime, \u201c[L]ike I said at the beginning, the search warrant we got to kind of keep an eye on you.... I can\u2019t leave you here with nobody here.\u201d JA 617-18.\nThe officers did not read Hashime his Miranda rights until over two hours into the interrogation.\nB.\nHashime was arrested three days after the interrogation. In July 2012 he was indicted on seven counts of production, distribution, receipt, and possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251 and 2252.\nPrior to trial, Hashime moved to suppress the statements he made to the law-enforcement agents during the interrogation on the grounds that he was in custody at the time and did not receive the required Miranda warning at the beginning of the interrogation. The district court rejected this motion, emphasizing Hash-ime\u2019s demeanor and tone during his interrogation, his general familiarity with law-enforcement practices, and his apparent lack of concern with any imminent arrest. The court relied in particular on the recording of the interrogation, stating that \u201cwere it not for the tape, I think you\u2019d [Hashime] win your case.\u201d JA 125-26. The court noted that \u201cthe voice of the defendant ... expressed no kind of hesitation, no nervousness\u201d and that the evidence of Hashime\u2019s \u201cforthcoming-ness\u201d was \u201cpowerful.\u201d JA 126. The court concluded that Hashime \u201cwas free to leave and ... believed himself to be free to leave.\u201d JA 129.\nHashime pled guilty to the receipt and possession charges, the former of which carried a mandatory minimum of five years in prison and a maximum sentence of twenty years. The government nevertheless chose to also prosecute Hashime on the production and distribution charges.\nAt the bench trial, multiple minors testified about their contacts with Hashime. Together with Hashime\u2019s statements during the interrogation, this evidence established Hashime\u2019s pattern of behavior: he would pose as an attractive teenage girl named Tracy and make contact with boys on websites used for anonymous chatting or through direct email communication. Hashime would offer \u2014 in many cases successfully \u2014 to trade nude pictures of Tracy for nude pictures of the boys. On occasion, he redistributed the pictures he obtained. The court found Hashime guilty of the production and distribution counts.\nPrior to sentencing, Hashime moved to strike the mandatory-minimum sentences applicable to him on the ground that they violated the Eighth Amendment. The district court denied the motion, finding proportionality review unavailable for a sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\nAt sentencing, the district court rejected the government\u2019s request for a thirty-year sentence as \u201cway more than would be appropriate.\u201d JA 451. The district court emphasized Hashime\u2019s youth and immaturity, and instead sentenced him to a fifteen-year sentence \u2014 the mandatory-minimum fifteen-year sentences for the production charges, and a combination of mandatory and non-mandatory five-year sentences on the other charges, all to run concurrently \u2014 followed by twenty years of supervised release.\nII.\nHashime first argues that his conviction should be reversed because law-enforcement agents failed to read him his Miranda rights at the beginning of the interrogation. \u201cWe review the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. When a suppression motion has been denied, this Court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d United States v. Davis, 690 F.3d 226, 233 (4th Cir.2012) (citations omitted).\nA.\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that \u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. As a prophylactic safeguard for this constitutional guarantee, the Supreme Court has required law enforcement to inform individuals who are in custody of their Fifth Amendment rights prior to interrogation. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); United States v. Parker, 262 F.3d 415, 419 (4th Cir.2001). Without a Miranda warning, evidence obtained from the interrogation is generally inadmissible. See id.; see also United States v. Hargrove, 625 F.3d 170, 177 (4th Cir.2010).\nWhen deciding whether a defendant not under formal arrest was in custody \u2014 and thus if the Miranda requirements apply \u2014 a court asks whether, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, \u2018a suspect\u2019s freedom of action [was] curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d Parker, 262 F.3d at 419 (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)). This inquiry is an objective one, and asks whether \u201c \u2018a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation\u2019 to be one of custody.\u201d United States v. Colonna, 511 F.3d 431, 435 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 422, 104 S.Ct. 3138). In other words, the court considers whether \u201ca reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d United States v. Jamison, 509 F.3d 628, 628 (4th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quoting Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFacts relevant to the custodial inquiry include, but are not limited to, \u201cthe time, place and purpose of the encounter, the words used by the officer, the officer\u2019s tone of voice and general demeanor, the presence of multiple officers, the potential display of a weapon by an officer, and whether there was any physical contact between the officer and the defendant.\u201d United States v. Day, 591 F.3d 679, 696 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting United States v. Weaver, 282 F.3d 302, 312 (4th Cir.2002)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Also pertinent are the suspect\u2019s isolation and separation from family, see United States v. Griffin, 7 F.3d 1512, 1519 (10th Cir.1993), and physical restrictions, United States v. Griffin, 922 F.2d 1343, 1347 (8th Cir.1990).\nB.\nThe district court ruled, and the government argues, that a Miranda warning was not required because Hashime was not in custody. There is no question that the officers interrogated Hashime and the custody question is the only one remaining. The government\u2019s case rests on two grounds: law enforcement\u2019s conduct toward and statements to Hashime prior to and during the interrogation, and Hashime\u2019s tone and demeanor during the interrogation. We address each in turn.\nThe government argues that the law-enforcement agents\u2019 behavior establishes that the interrogation was non-custodial. The government notes that, when the Hashime family was gathered in the living room, an agent said that no one was under arrest. Furthermore, at the beginning of the interview, one of the interrogators told Hashime that \u201cmost importantly we want you to know that you don\u2019t have to talk to us;\u201d that Hashime could \u201canswer some questions or not answer questions;\u201d and that he could \u201cleave any time.\u201d JA 473. The interrogators also informed Hashime, both before and after reading him his Miranda rights, that they were not there to arrest anyone but rather to execute a search warrant, and that the ultimate decision about arrest would be made by the prosecutor. The government also emphasizes that the interrogators offered Hash-ime multiple breaks for the bathroom and coffee, all of which Hashime declined. The government notes that Hashime was not handcuffed during the interrogation, that the door to the room in which he was interrogated was open, and that Hashime was sitting in the chair closest to the door.\nThe government\u2019s argument is fine as far as it goes, but it wholly ignores the larger setting. First, other statements made by law enforcement undercut the government\u2019s claim that Hashime was consistently told that he could leave at any time and did not need to answer any questions. During the interrogation, one of the officers told Hashime that, with respect to his prior sexual history with minors, \u201cI need to know, and I need you to be completely honest with me here even if you\u2019re afraid, I don\u2019t care if you say I don\u2019t want to answer that or I\u2019m afraid to answer it, but I need to know the truth.\u201d Likewise, when the interrogator left to go upstairs, he told Hashime, \u201c[L]ike I said at the beginning, the search warrant we got to kind of keep an eye on you---- I can\u2019t leave you here with nobody here.\u201d\nSecond, even to the extent that law enforcement told Hashime that he did not have to answer questions and was free to leave, that by itself does not make the interrogation non-custodial. Although a statement that the individual being interrogated is free to leave may be \u201chighly probative of whether, in the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have reason to believe he was \u2018in custody,\u2019 \u201d such a statement \u201cis not \u2018talismanic\u2019 or sufficient in and of itself to show a lack of custody.\u201d United States v. Hargrove, 625 F.3d 170, 180 (4th Cir.2010). The broader setting makes clear why a few isolated statements by law enforcement in the course of a three-hour interrogation cannot erase its custodial nature. Before the interrogation, Hashime had awoken at gunpoint to a harrowing scene: his house was occupied by a flood of armed officers who proceeded to evict him and his family and restrict their movements once let back inside. Throughout the interrogation, Hashime was isolated from his family members, with his mother\u2019s repeated requests to see him denied. It is little wonder that Hashime testified that, during the interrogation, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had any chance to leave.... I felt that I was ... trapped and ... had to stay where I was and do what I was told.\u201d JA 64.\nWe also cannot accept the argument that the home setting here rendered the interrogation non-custodial. While courts are generally less likely to characterize as custodial interrogations in familiar settings like the home, see 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.6(e), at 738-40 (3d ed.2007), the particular facts of Hash-ime\u2019s interrogation cut in the other direction. A suspect \u201cmay not feel that he can successfully terminate the interrogation if he knows that he cannot empty his home of his interrogators until they have completed their search.\u201d United States v. Craighead, 539 F.3d 1073, 1083 (9th Cir.2008). As Hashime testified during the suppression hearing, prior to being interrogated he did not feel that he could freely move through the house because the officers \u201chad people everywhere and telling us what to do, telling me what to do, and telling me where not to go and where to go.\u201d JA 64.\nThis case is similar to United States v. Colonna, 511 F.3d 431 (4th Cir.2007), where we found that an interrogation arising out of a search of the home was custodial for Miranda purposes. In Colonna, twenty-four FBI agents executed a search warrant on the defendant\u2019s home, looking for child pornography. Id. at 433. Our analysis in that case focused on many of the same factors that guide our inquiry here: the large number of armed law-enforcement agents, the suspect\u2019s isolation during his interrogation, and the suspect and his family\u2019s loss of control over their home. See id. at 436. Several of our sister circuits have found interrogations to be custodial in similar circumstances. See United States v. Cavazos, 668 F.3d 190, 194 (5th Cir.2012); Craighead, 539 F.3d at 1089; United States v. Mittelr-Carey, 493 F.3d 36, 39-40 (1st Cir.2007).\nThe government, following the district court, also argues that Hashime\u2019s tone and demeanor during the interrogation demonstrate that it was not custodial. It is true that Hashime was cooperative with his interrogators. He admitted he possessed child pornography, explained how he had received it, provided passwords to his computer, and described where the files were located on his hard drive. Hashime told the agents that \u201cI want to help you,\u201d and that \u201cI love helping cops. I\u2019ve always loved cops. I always wanted to be a cop.\u201d JA 540. It is also the case that the tone of the interrogation was calm and in some instances almost chatty, with Hashime asking the agents whether the investigation would affect his upcoming vacation plans and joking with them about the health hazards of smoking cigarettes.\nWhatever the nature of Hashime\u2019s tone and demeanor, it is not dispositive here of the custodial inquiry. As the Supreme Court has emphasized, the test for whether an interrogation was custodial is an objective one: \u201c[T]he subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned are irrelevant. The test, in other words, involves no consideration of the actual mindset of the particular suspect subjected to police questioning.\u201d J.D.B. v. North Carolina, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2394, 2402, 180 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also United States v. Parker, 262 F.3d 415, 419 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201cCustody determinations do not depend on the subjective views of either the interrogating law enforcement officers or of the person being questioned, but depend instead [on] the objective circumstances of the interrogation.\u201d).\nThe district court gave primary emphasis to the mannerisms of the defendant, remarking that Hashime\u2019s voice expressed \u201cno kind of hesitation, no nervousness,\u201d and that his attitude was a cooperative one. But Hashime\u2019s attitude\u2014 his apparent \u201cforthcoming-ness\u201d as the district court put it\u2014-is more of a subjective factor and goes primarily to the voluntariness of Hashime\u2019s confession. The voluntariness inquiry and the Miranda custody inquiry are, however, not one and the same. See Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 667-68, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004).\nIn contrast to Hashime\u2019s manner, the conduct of government agents is an objective factor informing the inquiry of whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave. Thus the government properly noted such factors as the agents\u2019 tone of voice, statements that Hashime was not under arrest, and offer of multiple breaks to the defendant. While these objective factors the government offers do cut against custody, they are decidedly outweighed by other, undisputed objective considerations\u2014among which is the sheer length of what the government would prefer to characterize as an \u201cinterview,\u201d but which was plainly an hours-long interrogation. As Hashime notes, his \u201chouse was swarming with federal and state agents, he was rousted from bed at gunpoint, held with family members and not allowed to move unless guarded, and ultimately separated from his family and placed in a small storage room with two agents where he was questioned\u201d by investigators, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15, who stated that he must remain under guard and that they needed \u201cto know the truth.\u201d\nWe thus hold that Hashime was in custody for the purposes of Miranda. Consequently, law enforcement\u2019s failure to read him his Miranda rights makes his testimony inadmissible and requires that his conviction be reversed.\nIII.\nHashime also raises an Eighth Amendment proportionality challenge to his mandatory fifteen-year sentence. (Hashime\u2019s guilty plea on the receipt charge carried its own five-year mandatory minimum.) The defense emphasizes Hashime\u2019s youth and immaturity. It contends that the offense conduct triggering the mandatory fifteen-year minimum for production did not remotely resemble \u201cthe typical production of child pornography. Rather it was the result of the unfortunately common use of the internet by sexually curious young people.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 40. His case, he argues, was \u201crare\u201d: \u201cFor the year 2010, the average age of those convicted of production was 42.\u201d Id. (citing U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report to Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses 257 n. 42 (2013)).\nThe government argues that Eighth Amendment proportionality review is not available for mandatory-minimum sentences of less than life without parole, and that any such review would neither be required by Supreme Court precedent nor compatible with our own. See, e.g., Ewing v. California, 538 U.S. 11, 30-31, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003); United States v. Malloy, 568 F.3d 166, 180 (4th Cir.2009). The government also contends that, even if proportionality review were available for Hashime\u2019s sentence, the mandatory m\u00ednimums for his child-pornography convictions would pass constitutional muster. The government notes that even after Hashime turned eighteen, he had sexual contact with two minor boys. And irrespective of what might constitute relevant conduct under the Sentencing Guidelines, the offense conduct itself included \u201cimpersonating a young girl named \u2018Tracy\u2019 \u201d in order to solicit nude photographs from minors. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 9.\nThe district court felt considerable unease with the mandatory m\u00ednimums sought by the government in this case. At sentencing, the court chafed at the prosecutors\u2019 use of their charging authority to \u201cget into sentencing decisions,\u201d and then-lack of respect for the sentencing discretion traditionally accorded district courts. JA 447. It stated that the mandatory-minimum sentences the charges required it to impose were not \u201cfair or just,\u201d arguing further that \u201c[t]his is the kind of case where the guidelines and mandatory m\u00edni-mums simply do not reflect the realities of the specific case and the specific defendant.\u201d JA 457.\nOur reversal of the conviction makes it unnecessary to address any sentencing questions. It suffices to note that, in line with our own review of the custody issue and the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing, this was a case in which both police and prosecution applied a heavy foot to the accelerator. We do not doubt for an instant that the defendant\u2019s conduct here was reprehensible and worthy of both investigation and punishment, as the guilty plea attests. But attention to balance and degree often distinguishes the wise exercise of prosecutorial discretion from its opposite. For now we leave to the reflection of the appropriate authorities whether it was necessary to throw the full force of the law against this 19-year-old in a manner that would very likely render his life beyond repair.\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse Hashime\u2019s conviction on the production and distribution counts. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\n. Hashime does not raise any Fourth Amendment challenges to the execution of the search warrant, and none are at issue here.\n. The government argues that, even if the district court erred in not suppressing Hash-ime\u2019s statements, the error was harmless. Given the seriousness and extent of Hash-ime\u2019s incriminating statements during the interrogation and the important role they played at trial, we disagree.",

        "text": "KING, Circuit Judge,\nconcurring:\nI concur fully in Judge Wilkinson\u2019s excellent opinion for the panel. I write separately, however, to draw attention to a misperception of the law of this Court with respect to whether a sentence short of life imprisonment may be reviewed to ensure that it is constitutionally proportionate to the offense of conviction, and not cruel and unusual in contravention of the Eighth Amendment. Every other court of appeals permits just that sort of proportionality review under the appropriate circumstances. So does ours, as I shall demonstrate, though the conventional wisdom may say otherwise.\nAfter Hashime submitted his principal brief, in which he argued that his fifteen-year sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate, he moved for initial hearing en bane. See Fed. R.App. P. 35(a). As justification for so doing, Hashime asserted that we had \u201cheld previously, as opposed to every other Circuit, that a sentence of a term of years (as opposed to a sentence of life), is not subject to the proportionality principle under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Motion for Hearing En Banc at 1. We denied initial hearing en banc because, as Judge Gregory (joined by Judge Davis) presaged, \u201cif Hashime\u2019s appeal is resolved on the [threshold] Miranda issue, his Eighth Amendment argument will be moot.\u201d United States v. Hashime, 722 F.3d 572, 572 (4th Cir.2013) (Gregory, J., concurring in denial of hearing en banc).\nAnd now that scenario has come to pass. See ante at 286 (\u201cOur reversal of the conviction makes it unnecessary to address any sentencing questions.\u201d). Still, it bears revisiting Judge Gregory\u2019s observation that our Eighth Amendment precedent as it applies to defendants sentenced to a term of years \u201cseemingly materialized from thin air,\u201d and has \u201cinexplicably morphed\u201d over the years. Hashime, 722 F.3d at 573. Our most recent published iteration of the rule occurred in United States v. Malloy, 568 F.3d 166 (4th Cir.2009), where we recited that because the defendant in that case had \u201creceived less than life without parole, proportionality review is not available under our precedent.\u201d Id. at 180 (citing United States v. Ming Hong, 242 F.3d 528, 532 (4th Cir.2001)). Malloy accurately characterized Ming Hong, in which we unabashedly asserted that \u201c[t]his court has held that proportionality review is not available for any sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u201d 242 F.3d at 532 (emphasis added) (citing United States v. Polk, 905 F.2d 54, 55 (4th Cir.1990)).\nUnfortunately, our opinion in Ming Hong misstated the precise language of Polk, in which we merely observed that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983), \u201cdoes not require a proportionality review of any sentence less than life imprisonment without possibility of parole.\u201d 905 F.2d at 55 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Obviously, to withhold a potential avenue of review entirely by simply declaring that it is \u201cnot available\u201d is hardly the same thing as exercising the discretion to only infrequently engage in such review under certain circumstances. Even before Ming Hong, we neglected to capture the essence of what Solem and Polk actually instructed, as we confidently maintained that \u201c[i]t is well-settled that proportionality review is not appropriate for any sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u201d United States v. Lockhart, 58 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1995) (emphasis added) (citing Polk). The irrefutable implication of Solem and Polk, however, is to the contrary, that is, proportionality review of a term-of-years sentence \u2014 -though not required in every case, or even, perhaps, in most cases \u2014 is, contrary to Lockhart and Ming Hong, appropriate and available in some cases.\nAlthough our recent line of authority addressing the issue has, understandably, visited ambiguity and confusion upon the bench and bar, the way going forward is clear. Where, as here, \u201cthere is an irreconcilable conflict between opinions issued by three-judge panels of this court, the first case to decide the issue is the one that must be followed, unless and until it is overruled by this court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d McMellon v. United States, 387 F.3d 329, 334 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc). The 1990 decision in Polk, authored by our distinguished predecessor Judge Russell, thus states the law of our circuit: where a sentence of less than life imprisonment has been imposed upon a defendant, proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment is discretionary.",
