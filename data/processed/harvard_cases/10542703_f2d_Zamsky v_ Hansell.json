        "text": "ORDER\nThe petition for rehearing is granted. The memorandum disposition, filed August 10, 1990, 911 F.2d 740, is withdrawn, and the attached per curiam opinion is filed in its place. The full court has been advised of the suggestion for en banc rehearing and no judge has requested a vote thereon. The suggestion for rehearing en banc is therefore rejected. Fed.R.App.P. 35(b).\nOPINION\nPER CURIAM:\nToday we address a question of immunity: Are state officials who unconstitutionally cause land to be rezoned absolutely immune from liability for the damage caused by their unlawful conduct?\nFacts\nThe Oregon Land Conservation and Development Commission (the LCDC) has two primary functions. First, it adopts \u201cgoals\u201d which become the mandatory state-wide planning standards with which all local land use plans must comply. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 197.015(8), 197.040(l)(c) (1989). It also reviews the comprehensive land use plans which local governments are required to create and adopt, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.175(2)(a), for conformity with the state-wide goals, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.040(2)(d). A local land use plan becomes effective if and only if the LCDC \u201cacknowledges\u201d that it meets the statewide goals. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 197.015(1), 197.175(2)(c), (2)(d). If the plan does not conform with the state-wide goals, the LCDC may issue a continuance order and explain how to bring the plan into compliance. See Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(12).\nPlaintiff Zamsky owns 1,950 acres of undeveloped land in Klamath County. In 1984, Klamath County rezoned his land in response to an LCDC continuance order that approved parts of Klamath County\u2019s comprehensive land use plan but required the county to rezone or make additional findings with respect to plaintiffs property-\nOn December 31, 1986, plaintiff filed this section 1983 action, alleging that James Ross, the Director of Land Conservation and Development, and the LCDC Commissioners violated his constitutional rights under the equal protection, due process and takings clauses. His property, he contends, was worth $3,500,000 before being rezoned, but is worth only $200,000 as rezoned pursuant to the continuance order. He also argues that because the LCDC acknowledged his proposed development in 1982, it was precluded under Oregon\u2019s Administrative Rules from reviewing his property again.\nThe magistrate determined that Ross and the LCDC Commissioners were entitled to absolute immunity because they were acting in a legislative capacity. On that basis, he granted their motions for summary judgment. Zamsky appeals.\nDiscussion\nIn determining whether to issue an acknowledgment order, the LCDC Commissioners were ruling on whether the county\u2019s proposed plan complied with existing regulations, namely the \u201cgoals\u201d with which all local comprehensive plans must comply. They were not exercising independent legislative judgment. Thus, this case closely resembles Cinevision Corp. v. City of Burbank, 745 F.2d 560, 580 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1054, 105 S.Ct. 2115, 85 L.Ed.2d 480 (1985). In Cinevision, the defendants monitored compliance with a contract; here the LCDC monitors compliance with LCDC goals. Monitoring compliance with established laws or regulations and offering recommendations on how compliance may be achieved is an executive function, involving \u201cad hoc decisionmaking\u201d rather than \u201cformulation of policy.\u201d See id. Because the LCDC Commissioners and staff member Ross acted in an executive function in suggesting or demanding changes to local plans, they are not entitled to absolute immunity. Id.\nThe LCDC points to that portion of Cinevision which notes that \u201cthe enactment of a general zoning ordinance is a legislative act\u201d which carries absolute immunity. Cinevision, 745 F.2d at 577. Passing the goals which become the statewide master zoning plan is clearly a legislative act; but Zamsky didn\u2019t sue the LCDC for enacting the master plan. And while the LCDC also has a role which might be considered legislative \u2014 confirming local plans and thereby giving them the force of law \u2014 Zamsky didn\u2019t sue the LCDC for exercising that power either. Instead, Zamsky sued the LCDC for singling out his property and demanding that the local legislature amend its plan so as to make Zamsky\u2019s property virtually worthless. Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial 5, FIT 9-10 (Dec. 31, 1986), ER 5. Thus, Zamsky challenges \u201can action against a specific individual enforcing the general zoning ordinance\u201d \u2014 an executive action subject only to qualified immunity. Id. at 578 (citing Kuzinich v. County of Santa Clara, 689 F.2d 1345, 1349 (9th Cir.1982)).\nNor do the LCDC Commissioners act in a judicial capacity. To begin with, their proceedings often are not adversarial. Contrast Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 512, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2913, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). Second, the LCDC Commissioners do not simply decide whether to acknowledge the plan but may explain how to bring the plan into compliance. See Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(12). Offering recommendations on how to comply with the law is an executive, not judicial function. And finally, unlike the professional administrative law judges in Butz, the LCDC Commissioners are not insulated from the agency that promulgates the rules to be applied. Instead, they are the same individuals who promulgate the \u201cgoals\u201d in the first place; they combine the functions of lawmaker and monitor of compliance. Such combined functions are not uncommon at the local level, but they are inconsistent with the judicial role and judicial immunity. See Butz, 438 U.S. at 513-14, 98 S.Ct. at 2914 (noting the extensive mechanisms used to insulate AUs from the agency in which they serve); see also Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 319-20, 95 S.Ct. 992, 999, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975) (noting the combined legislative and adjudicative functions of school board members and concluding that they are not entitled to absolute immunity); Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U.S. 193, 203-04, 106 S.Ct. 496, 501-02, 88 L.Ed.2d 507 (1985) (prison disciplinary board members who also serve as prison guards not absolutely immune).\nFinally, the LCDC argues that forcing officials to prove they\u2019re entitled to qualified immunity will deter individuals from serving on the LCDC. However, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded us that qualified immunity \u201cis not of small consequence.... [Ijnsubstantial lawsuits can be recognized and be quickly disposed of, and firm application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2018will ensure that federal officials are not harassed by frivolous lawsuits.\u2019 \u201d Cleavinger, 474 U.S. at 206-07, 106 S.Ct. at 503, quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 507-08, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2911, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). The cost of establishing the defense of qualified immunity is simply part of the price of having a viable remedy for constitutional violations; it is not a sufficient reason, in and of itself, for finding governmental actors to be absolutely immune.\nWe reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings including consideration of defendants\u2019 claims of qualified immunity.\n. Contrary to the dissent's assertion, see dissent at 680, there is nothing misleading about this question. It\u2019s true that the district court never reached the merits of constitutional claim, but that\u2019s precisely the point:\nIf state officials are absolutely immune, they can't be held liable, no matter how lawful or lawless their conduct; they could single out an individual based on his race, religion or dislike of sushi, and no damages would lie. The question here is whether the culpable will be held accountable. After all, officials who don\u2019t violate clearly recognized rights will be entitled to qualified immunity \u2014 and will not be liable \u2014 regardless of how this case is decided.",

        "text": "ALARCON: Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nI respectfully dissent.\nPREFATORY STATEMENT\nThe majority has framed the question we must resolve in this appeal as follows: \u201cAre state officials who unconstitutionally cause land to be rezoned absolutely immune from liability for the damages caused by their conduct?\u201d This statement of the issue is misleading. The district court did not reach the merits of Zamsky\u2019s constitutional claim. Instead, the district court held that it could not reach the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim because the appellees were absolutely immune from damages liability.\nThe district court concluded that the director and the members of Oregon Land Conservation and Development Commission (the LCDC) were acting in a legislative capacity when they reviewed Klamath County\u2019s comprehensive land use plan. The majority has found that the LCDC\u2019s approval of the Klamath County comprehensive land development plan was an executive act specifically directed at Zam-sky\u2019s property. The record does not support the majority\u2019s factual finding. The record shows that the LCDC ruled on Kla-math County\u2019s application for approval of its comprehensive land use plan as required under Oregon law. In reviewing Klamath County\u2019s application, the LCDC exercised its legislative power to disapprove or \u201cveto\u201d those portions of the Klamath County comprehensive plan that did not comply with land use goals adopted by the LCDC pursuant to Oregon law. Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the district court.\nAPPLICABLE OREGON LAW\nBefore setting forth the relevant facts in this case, I will summarize Oregon law concerning land development. In 1973, the Oregon legislature created a comprehensive land use scheme \u201c[t]o promote coordinated administration of land uses consistent with comprehensive plans adopted throughout the state.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.005(2) (1989). To achieve its goals, Oregon created the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC). It consists of seven members appointed by the governor for four year terms. Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 197.030(1), (3) (1989). The LCDC directs the Director of Land Conservation and Development (Director) in the performance of his or her duties. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.040(l)(a) (1989).\nThe LCDC is the primary state agency responsible for carrying out Oregon\u2019s land use scheme. See Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 197.040, 197.320 (1989). Oregon has delegated to the LCDC the duty of adopting \u201cgoals\u201d that constitute \u201cthe mandatory statewide planning standards\u201d with which all local comprehensive plans must comply. Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 197.015(8), 197.040(1), (2)(a) (1989). Under the statute, local governments must create and adopt comprehensive plans to control land use decisions within their jurisdictions. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 197.010, 197.175 (1989). A comprehensive plan is defined as \u201ca generalized, coordinated land use map and policy statement of the governing body of the local government that interrelates all functional and natural systems and activities relating to the use of lands_\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.015(5) (1989).\nLocal governments must submit their comprehensive plans to the LCDC for \u201cacknowledgment\u201d review pursuant to section 197.251. The LCDC must review the comprehensive plan for compliance with the goals. If the plan is consistent with the goals it is \u201cacknowledged\u201d under section 197.251. Once acknowledged, the plan constitutes the rules and policies by which local governments must make land use decisions. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.175(2)(d) (1989). If the plan is not acknowledged, it does not constitute the rules for land use decisions and the LCDC\u2019s goals continue to be the rules by which local land use decisions must be made. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.175(1), (2)(c) (1989). Thus, the LCDC functions as an integral part of the legislative process with respect to the adoption of rules and policies for land use decisions within each local jurisdiction.\nWhen reviewing a comprehensive plan, the LCDC may issue any one of three orders: an acknowledgment order, which recognizes that the plan meets all goal requirements and gives the plan the force of law; a continuance order, which requires the local government to revise its plan within a specified time; or, a denial order. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(1) (1989).\nThe LCDC must limit its acknowledgment orders to identified geographic areas within the comprehensive plan area if there are other specific areas within the plan that do not comply with the goals. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(6) (1989). Thus, the LCDC may issue acknowledgment orders as to parts of a comprehensive plan and continuance or denial orders as to other parts. Id. These orders must specifically identify the goals that were met, the goals that were not met, and the areas affected. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(5), (6) (1989). The LCDC must specify amendments to the plan that would bring it into compliance. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(12) (1989). The LCDC\u2019s acknowledgment, continuance, and denial orders can be appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.650 (1989).\nThe specific procedure that must be followed by the LCDC in the review process is as follows: the Director of Land Conservation and Development must prepare a report for consideration by the LCDC analyzing the comprehensive plan\u2019s compliance with the goals. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(2) (1989). Interested persons must be provided a reasonable opportunity to present comments and objections for the Director\u2019s consideration. Id. Before the Director submits the report to the LCDC, he must allow local governments and persons who submitted written comments or objections an opportunity to file written exceptions to the report. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(3).\nThe LCDC must limit its review of the comprehensive plan to the record before the local government and Director\u2019s report, along with the exceptions, comments, and objections submitted. Oral argument before the LCDC by persons who filed written comments, objections, or exceptions may be allowed. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(4) (1989).\nB. Pertinent Facts\nThe facts are not in dispute in this matter; neither party contests the district court\u2019s findings. This matter arises out of actions taken by the LCDC regarding Kla-math County\u2019s comprehensive land use plan that resulted in a restriction in the development of Zamsky\u2019s land. Zamsky argues that the LCDC violated his constitutional rights when it concluded the proposed development of his land, pursuant to Klamath County\u2019s comprehensive land use plan, did not comply with mandatory statewide goals.\nZamsky owns 1,950 acres of undeveloped land in Klamath County. Before Klamath County adopted a comprehensive land use plan on November 25, 1981, the county had previously zoned Zamsky\u2019s property as a \u201cPlanned Unit Development\u201d (PUD) with a building density of not more than one dwelling per five acres. Interested citizens appealed Klamath County\u2019s zoning decision to the LCDC in Ager v. Klamath County, LCDC Case No. 79-030. The LCDC determined that the PUD zoning violated the mandatory statewide goals because the decision was unsupported by \u201cfindings and reasons explaining compliance with the goals\u201d and no showing was made as to why the development should be approved before the adoption of a comprehensive plan. Director\u2019s Report of January 28, 1981.\nOn November 25, 1981, subsequent to the LCDC\u2019s decision in Ager v. Klamath County, Klamath County adopted a comprehensive land development plan (the 1981 Klamath County Plan). It was submitted to the LCDC on December 2, 1981 for \u201cacknowledgment review\u201d pursuant to Oregon Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251(1). The 1981 Klamath County Plan designated Zamsky\u2019s property as \u201cPlanned Unit' Development\u201d (PUD) land and provided for a building density of no more than one dwelling per five acres. The Zamsky property was classified as \u201crural\u201d except for ten acres set aside for commercial uses. The LCDC had rejected the PUD proposal in Ager v. Klamath County. Because Klamath County had not changed the zoning following the LCDC\u2019s ruling in Ager v. Klamath County, the LCDC required the County to identify additional facts and reasons to justify its decision not to comply with the earlier order. This requirement was contained in an LCDC order that granted Klamath County additional time to complete its comprehensive plan.\nPursuant to the order requiring Klamath County to justify its decision not to change the PUD zoning, the Director conducted an initial review of the 1981 Klamath County Plan to determine whether the county had complied with the LCDC\u2019s directions in Ager v. Klamath County. On January 28, 1982 the Director issued a report \u201cgenerally assessing] Klamath County\u2019s response to five appeal cases [including Ager v. Klamath County ] in which there was a serious potential for overturning [the plan] if the County\u2019s ... [1981] plan was adopted without appropriate findings and revisions.\u201d Director\u2019s Report of January 28, 1982. The report concluded that the 1981 Klamath County Plan \u201cappealed] to comply with the earlier direction given by the Commission, at least to the extent that a legislative decision is expected to address the goals.\u201d\nThe Director\u2019s January 28, 1982 report did not purport to review the 1981 Klamath County Plan to determine whether it complied with LCDC\u2019s statewide goals. The Director\u2019s report regarding Klamath County\u2019s compliance with the mandatory land use goals was dated February 18, 1982.\nOn March 22, 1982, the LCDC completed its goal compliance review of the 1981 Kla-math County Plan. The LCDC concluded that \u201cKlamath County\u2019s comprehensive plan and implementing measures do not comply with the Statewide Planning Goals.\u201d The LCDC specifically adopted the findings and recommendations contained in sections IV and V of the Director\u2019s February 18, 1982, report and issued a continuance order. Sections IV and V of the Director\u2019s report detail the nature of the goal violations and the steps necessary to correct the problems. The report specifically recommended that the LCDC \u201cdeny Kla-math County\u2019s request for acknowledgment.\u201d The report recommended amendments to the plan\u2019s zoning maps to provide a suitable rural plan designation for certain areas. New policies and zoning were required for lands \u201cnot within adopted urban growth boundaries.\u201d , In addition, the LCDC required additional findings relating to types and levels of public services that would be necessary in rural lands.\nSpecifically, the LCDC found that the 1981 Klamath County Plan complied with goals 1 (Citizen Involvement), 6 (Air, Water, and Land Resources Quality), 8 (Recreational Needs), 10 (Housing), and 13 (Energy Conservation), but found that the Plan did not comply with goals 2 (Land Use Planning), 3 (Agricultural Lands), 4 (Forest Lands), 5 (Open Spaces, Scenic and Historic Areas, Natural Resources), 7 (Areas Subject to Natural Disasters and Hazards), 9 (Economy of the State), 11 (Public Facilities and Services), 12 (Transportation), and 14 (Urbanization, as it related to goal 2). The continuance order specifically addressed Klamath County\u2019s proposed PUD zone and rural lands.\nThe LCDC recommended that amendments be adopted to the 1981 Klamath County Plan to describe the type and levels of public services and facilities necessary for the rural communities. In addition, the LCDC determined that the rural community boundaries appeared to be too large and required additional findings concerning rural boundaries. The LCDC\u2019s recommendations did not refer to any specific property; they applied generally to the rural and the proposed PUD zone areas. No reference was made to Zamsky\u2019s property. None of the areas set forth in the 1981 Klamath County Plan were \u201cacknowledged\u201d as being in compliance with the mandatory statewide goals.\nKlamath County amended its comprehensive plan on December 21, 1982 in an attempt to bring it into compliance with the LCDC\u2019s recommendations regarding goal compliance. None of the county\u2019s amendments affected Zamsky\u2019s property. On May 16, 1983, the LCDC concluded its review of the first amended plan and issued another continuance order. The LCDC determined that the amended plan did not comply with the mandatory statewide goals. The LCDC remained concerned with the \u201cappropriate level of sewer and water facilities\u201d necessary for the rural communities and also required amendments with respect to proposed residential and nonresource zones. The report pointed out problems resulting from \u201cthe piecemeal designation and zoning of individual properties based totally on ownership\u201d rather than goal compliance. Continuance Order of May 16, 1983. Zamsky\u2019s property was not specifically mentioned.\nOn February 16, 1984, Klamath County again amended its comprehensive land use plan in order to comply with the LCDC\u2019s recommendations. Prior to the time these amendments were made, Zamsky submitted a master development plan to the county for approval in the Fall of 1983. The County Planning Commission held hearings, but delayed making a decision. Zamsky filed a mandamus action with the Klamath County Circuit Court to compel the County Planning Commission to approve his master development plan. On March 23, 1984, that court ordered Kla-math County to approve the application or show cause why it had not been approved. Klamath County approved Zamsky\u2019s application on March 30, 1984. Several County residents appealed Klamath County\u2019s approval of Zamsky\u2019s proposed development. Their appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute on June 19, 1984. The LCDC was not a party to the proceedings.\nOn August 6, 1984, the LCDC concluded its review of the second set of amendments to the 1981 Klamath County Plan. None of Klamath County\u2019s amendments to the comprehensive land use plan referred to the proposed PUD zoning of Zamsky\u2019s property. In an order dated August 6, 1984, the LCDC determined that the 1981 Klamath County Plan, as amended, complied with the goals except for specific areas, including Zamsky\u2019s property, that violated goals 2 (Land Use Planning) and 14 (Urbanization). The LCDC issued an acknowledgment order solely as to those portions of the amended 1981 Klamath County Plan that complied with the goals. A continuance order was issued regarding those portions that did not comply. The continuance order required Klamath County to make additional findings with respect to the portions of the comprehensive land use plan that did not comply, or to replan and rezone those properties. The continuance order specifically referred to the proposed development of Zamsky\u2019s property as requiring additional findings to demonstrate its compliance with the mandatory statewide use goals.\nIn response to the August 6, 1984 continuance order, Klamath County rezoned Zam-sky\u2019s land to allow for one dwelling per 20 acres. Zamsky appealed the county\u2019s zoning decision to the Land Use Board of Appeals. The Board dismissed the appeal on February 8, 1985.\nThe LCDC reviewed the amended 1981 Klamath County Plan on May 23, 1985. It determined that the comprehensive land use plan, including the requirement that Zamsky\u2019s property be limited to one dwelling per 20 acres, complied with the mandatory statewide goals. The LCDC issued an acknowledgment order on May 31, 1985.\nZamsky appealed from the decision of the LCDC on February 24, 1986 to the Oregon Court of Appeals. In that appeal, Zamsky alleged that the LCDC acted beyond the scope of its authority in issuing its order limiting the development of his land. Zamsky expressly reserved any federal questions. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the LCDC\u2019s decision without opinion. Zamsky v. Land Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 80 Or.App. 461, 721 P.2d 482 (1986).\nZamsky filed this section 1983 action on December 31, 1986. He alleged that the LCDC Commissioners and Ross, LCDC\u2019s director, violated his constitutional rights under the equal protection, due process, and takings clauses. Zamsky contends that his property, which was worth $3,500,-000 under the one dwelling per five acres zoning, is now worth only $200,000. He argues that because the LCDC had acknowledged his proposed development plan in 1982, it was precluded from again reviewing his property by Oregon Administrative Rule 660 \u2014 03\u2014025(8).\nANALYSIS\nZamsky contends that Ross and the LCDC Commissioners acted in a \u201cclassic executive administrative function\u201d in \u201creviewing] city and county land use plans and zoning ordinances to determine if they are in compliance with ... [land use] goals.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10. The record does not support this contention.\nState legislators are absolutely immune from liability for damages resulting from the performance of their duties. Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 403, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1178, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979); Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 372-75, 71 S.Ct. 783, 786-87, 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951). Whether a state public official acts in a legislative capacity is determined by the duties that are performed, not the title bestowed on the individual. Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U.S. 193, 201, 106 S.Ct. 496, 500, 88 L.Ed.2d 507 (1985). In Cleavinger, the Supreme Court held that immunity analysis requires a functional approach that \u201crests on functional categories, not on the status of the defendant.\u201d Id. Immunity analysis focuses on the \u201cnature or function\u201d of the person\u2019s activities. Ybarra v. Reno Thunderbird Mobile Home Village, 723 F.2d 675, 678 (9th Cir.1984).\nIn Lake Country Estates, the Supreme Court concluded that members of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency acted in a legislative capacity in adopting a land use ordinance. Lake Country Estates, 440 U.S. at 406, 99 S.Ct. at 1179. The Court held: \u201c[T]o the extent the evidence discloses that these individuals were acting in a capacity comparable to that of members of a state legislature, they are entitled to absolute immunity from federal damages liability.\u201d Id.\nUnder Oregon\u2019s Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act, the LCDC Commissioners are required to adopt, amend, and review land use goals and review comprehensive plans adopted by local governments for compliance with such goals. Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 197.040(2)(a), 197.251(1) (1989). Zamsky correctly concedes that the adoption of land use goals is \u201cclearly a legislative function.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9. He argues that the acknowledgment function is not legislative.\nUnder Oregon Law, a comprehensive land use plan adopted by a local government has no force of law until it is acknowledged by the LCDC. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.175(2)(c), (d) (1989). Thus, in performing this duty, the LCDC\u2019s role is similar to the function of the president, or a governor in signing or vetoing a statute adopted by legislature. Without the concurrence of the president or the governor, the legislative process is not complete.\nIn Edwards v. United States, 286 U.S. 482, 52 S.Ct. 627, 76 L.Ed. 1239 (1932), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe President\u2019s function in approving or disapproving bills\u201d is a legislative function. Id. at 490 (citing La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 423, 454, 20 S.Ct. 168, 178, 44 L.Ed. 223 (1899)); see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 121, 96 S.Ct. 612, 683, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (\u201cthe President is a participant in the law-making process by virtue of his authority to veto bills enacted by Congress\u201d); see also Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 373, 52 S.Ct. 397, 401, 76 L.Ed. 795 (1932) (where state law requires the governor\u2019s participation before a statute \u201ccould be put in force,\u201d such action is \u201ca performance of the function of the legislature as a law making body.\u201d)\nZamsky argues that absolute immunity is not available to Ross and the LCDC Commissioners because they \u201cdirected that specific actions be taken with reference to Plaintiff\u2019s Property.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10. This argument lacks merit because the LCDC function in granting acknowledgment or in preventing a zoning ordinance from having any legal effect is a mandatory part of its legislative function under Oregon law. The LCDC had no authority to \u201cput into force\u201d Klamath County\u2019s land use plan for Zamsky\u2019s property unless it complied with the mandatory statewide goals. A similar claim was rejected in Hernandez v. City of LaFayette, 643 F.2d 1188 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 907, 102 S.Ct. 1251, 71 L.Ed.2d 444 (1982). In Hernandez, as in the instant matter, the plaintiff filed a section 1983 action against the City of LaFayette and its mayor. Id. at 1189. He contended that the failure to rezone his land denied him of his property without due process and just compensation under the fifth and fourteenth amendments. Id. The plaintiff in Hernandez obtained a unanimous vote from the city council to rezone his land. The mayor vetoed the ordinance. Id. at 1190-91. In his complaint, Hernandez alleged that the city was motivated by a desire to maintain the depressed market value of his land to keep condemnation costs at a minimum. Id. at 1191. The district court concluded that the mayor was protected by the doctrine of absolute immunity because he acted in a legislative capacity in exercising his veto powers. Id. at 1191-92. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. It reasoned as follows:\nThe mayor\u2019s veto, like the veto of the President or a state governor, is undeniably a part of the legislative process. It differs only in that it takes place on the local level. When the mayor exercises his veto power, it constitutes the policy-making decision of an individual elected official. It is as much an exercise of legislative decision-making as is the vote of a member of Congress, a state legislator, or a city councilman. We, therefore, hold that the district court properly dismissed plaintiff\u2019s action against the may- or because the mayor was absolutely immune from suit in connection with his vetoes of the ordinances to rezone plaintiff\u2019s land.\nId. at 1194.\nSimilarly, in the matter before this court, the record shows that when the orders were issued by the LCDC in withholding approval of the 1981 Klamath County Plan, it was exercising its power to prevent the land use plan from having any legal effect until it met the development goals. The exercise of a \u201cveto\u201d power is a classic legislative function. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 121, 96 S.Ct. at 683. In Edwards, 286 U.S. at 490, 52 S.Ct. at 630, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe President\u2019s function in approving or disapproving bills\u201d is a legislative function.\nZamsky argues that our decisions in Kuzinich v. County of Santa Clara, 689 F.2d 1345 (9th Cir.1982), Cinevision Cory, v. City of Burbank, 745 F.2d 560 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1054, 105 S.Ct. 2115, 85 L.Ed.2d 480 (1985), and Bateson v. Geisse, 857 F.2d 1300 (9th Cir.1988), demonstrate that the LCDC does not act in a legislative capacity when it refuses to permit a comprehensive land use plan to take effect because it declines to acknowledge a county\u2019s zoning of an individual landowner\u2019s property. The cited cases do not support this proposition. Furthermore, none of them involve an interpretation of a statute giving a state land use agency the power to prevent a zoning ordinance from having any legal effect if it fails to meet certain prescribed goals established by that agency.\nIn Kuzinich, the operator of an adult movie theater and an adult bookstore applied for a third land use permit to authorize him to continue operating these businesses. Kuzinich, 689 F.2d at 1347. Before his application was acted upon by the planning commission, the Board of Supervisors directed the county counsel to file an action to enjoin the operation of the movie theater and the bookstore. On the same date, the Board of Supervisors adopted an emergency amendment to the zoning ordinances which made the operation of Kuzi-nich\u2019s adult businesses unlawful at their current locations. Id.\nWe held in Kuzinich that the members of the Board of Supervisors were absolutely immune regarding the adoption of the emergency ordinance that outlawed Kuzi-nich\u2019s businesses at their present addresses. Kuzinich, 689 F.2d at 1349-50 (citing, inter alia, Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979), and Hernandez v. City of Lafayette, 643 F.2d 1188 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 907, 102 S.Ct. 1251, 71 L.Ed.2d 444 (1982)). We distinguished this legislative act from the action of the Board of Supervisors in ordering the county counsel to file a suit to enjoin the operation of Kuzmich\u2019s businesses. We held that this act was an exercise of the Supervisors\u2019 executive function. Id. at 1350. In the matter sub judice, the LCDC Commissioners did not adopt a new emergency measure whose sole purpose was to ban a specific individual\u2019s use of his property. Instead, the LCDC Commissioners informed Klamath County that the comprehensive land use plan would not be permitted to take effect until it was in compliance with the mandatory statewide goals. As discussed above, Oregon law expressly directs the LCDC to deny legal effect to a local government\u2019s land use plan that does not comply with mandatory statewide goals.\nIn Cinevision, the city entered into a contract with the Cinevision Corporation permitting it to promote concerts in a municipally owned amphitheater. Cinevision, 745 F.2d at 565. The Burbank City Council rejected six of the Cinevision Corporation\u2019s events. Cinevision Corporation filed an action under section 1983 alleging first amendment violations. Id. One member of the city council, James Richman, was named as a defendant. The district court concluded that Councilman Richman was not entitled to absolute immunity in voting to disapprove the concerts. Id. at 577.\nIn affirming the district court\u2019s ruling in Cinevision, we applied the functional test. We concluded that in voting on whether to approve specific proposed concerts, the councilman was administering a municipal contract with a specific corporation, rather than formulating legislative policy or promulgating a rule of conduct with general application. Id. at 580. We declined, however, to adopt the rule suggested by Zam-sky in this matter, that would define an executive act as \u201can act directed at one or a few individuals.\u201d Id. at 579.\nUnlike the circumstances in Cinevision, the LCDC Commissioners were not monitoring Zamsky\u2019s performance under a comprehensive land use plan that had been previously acknowledged. The LCDC continuation order was directed at requiring Klamath County to comply with mandatory land use goals as a pre-condition to the approval of its comprehensive plan as required under Oregon law.\nIn Bateson, the City Council of Billings, Montana, voted to withhold the issuance of a building permit to the plaintiff \u201calthough all requirements had been satisfied.\u201d Bateson, 857 F.2d at 1302. The City of Billings\u2019 regulations \u201cdo not provide for review by the City Council before a building permit can issue.\u201d Id. at 1303 (emphasis added). Bateson filed a section 1983 action against individual members of the Billings City Council. The district court concluded that absolute immunity did not apply. Id. at 1302. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. Relying on Kuzi-nich, we held that \u201cthe executive, rather than legislative, nature of their decision to arbitrarily withhold Bateson\u2019s building permit precludes any absolute immunity for their constitutional tort.\u201d Id. at 1304.\nIn Bateson, the Billings City Council had no authority to review the applicant\u2019s building permit. In the instant matter, the LCDC was required by Oregon law to review the 1981 Klamath County Plan before permitting it to be put in force. Thus, unlike the Billings City Council, the LCDC Commissioners were performing their prescribed legislative function in insisting that that portion of Klamath County\u2019s comprehensive land use plan that referred to the proposed development of Zamsky\u2019s property comply with the mandatory statewide goals.\nConclusion\nMy esteemed colleagues have mischarac-terized the LCDC\u2019s continuance order requiring Klamath County to redraft its comprehensive plan to comply with Oregon\u2019s mandatory land use goals as \u201can action against a specific individual.\u201d Opinion at 679. This error has led the majority to conclude that our decision in Cinevision compels reversal. In Cinevision, the plaintiff sued because of the City Council\u2019s conduct in executing a contract authorizing concerts on municipal property. We concluded that the City Council\u2019s actions were purely administrative. In this matter, the LCDC did not take action against a specific individual. The LCDC simply carried out its legislative function to \u201cveto\u201d Klamath County\u2019s comprehensive land plan because it did not comply with Oregon\u2019s land use goals.\nThe LCDC\u2019s acknowledgment of a local government\u2019s land-use plans, giving them the force of law, is a legislative function. An acknowledgment constitutes \u201cthe formulation and promulgation of legislative policy as a defined and binding rule of conduct.\u201d Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 424, 64 S.Ct. 660, 667, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944). A corollary to the acknowledgment power is the power to veto local legislation and thereby prevent it from having any legal effect. Absent LCDC acknowledgment, there is no binding rule of conduct because local land-use plans have no legal effect until they receive LCDC approval. The LCDC exercises its \u201cveto\u201d power either in the form of a denial or continuance order. Zamsky has challenged the LCDC\u2019s exercise of this function. The Supreme Court instructed in Lake Country Estates, 440 U.S. at 406, 99 S.Ct. at 1179, that to the extent that the agency members act in a legislative capacity, they are entitled to absolute immunity.\nBecause the defendants acted in a legislative capacity in this matter, I would affirm the district court\u2019s determination that they are entitled to absolute immunity.\n. The relevant portions of section 197.251 are set forth below:\n197.251 Compliance acknowledgment; commission review; rules; limited acknowledgment planning extension; compliance schedule.\n(1) Upon the request of a local government, the commission shall by order grant, deny or continue acknowledgment of compliance with the goals....\n(2) In accordance with rules of the commission, the director shall prepare a report for the commission stating whether the comprehensive plan and land use regulations for which acknowledgment is sought are in compliance with the goals....\n(5) A commission order granting, denying or continuing acknowledgment shall include a clear statement of findings which sets forth the basis for the approval, denial or continuance of acknowledgment. The findings shall:\n(a) Identify the goals with which the comprehensive plan and land use regulations comply and those with which they do not comply; and\n(b) Include a clear statement of findings in support of the determinations of compliance and noncompliance.\n(6) A commission order granting acknowledgment shall be limited to an identifiable geographic area described in the order if:\n(a) Only the identified geographic area is the subject of the acknowledgment request; or\n(b) Specific geographic areas do not comply with the goals, and the goal requirements are not technical or minor in nature.\nOr.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 197.251 (1989).\n. Oregon Administrative Rule 660-03-025(8) states:\nWhen the Commission resumes its consideration of the acknowledgment request, submitted subsequent to a continuance order, it shall limit its review to a determination of whether the corrections submitted bring the acknowledgment submission into conformance with the Statewide Planning Goals found not to be complied with in the previous review, unless conformance with other Goals is affected by the corrections.",
