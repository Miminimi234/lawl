        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nBefore this Court is a petition for review of a final order of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) revoking Jones Total Health Care Pharmacy, LLC\u2019s (\u201cJones Pharmacy\u201d) certif\u00edcate of registration under the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) to dispense controlled substances and denying SND Healthcare, LLC\u2019s (\u201cSND Healthcare\u201d) application for a certificate of registration to dispense controlled substances. The DEA Acting Administrator revoked Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration after determining that it unlawfully dispensed controlled substances and that Cherese Jones, the pharmacy\u2019s owner and operator,, failed to accept full responsibility for the misconduct. Because Jones also owned and operated SND Healthcare, the Acting Administrator denied SND Healthcare\u2019s pending application for the same reasons. Jones Pharmacy and SND Healthcare (\u201cPetitioners\u201d) then filed this petition for review, arguing that the DEA\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious. We disagree, so we deny.the petition for review.\nI.\nJones Pharmacy-is a community pharmacy started by Jones in Fort Lauderdale. Jones graduated from Texas A & M University with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in 2000 and worked in clinical and retail pharmacy positions before opening Jones Pharmacy in February 2010.\nJones Pharmacy was registered with the DEA to dispense substances controlled by the CSA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. In 2013, Jones sought to open SND Healthcare and submitted an application for registration to dispens\u00e9 controlled substances through that entity.\nThe CSA creates \u201ca closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the CSA.\u201d See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 13, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). Pharmacies that dispense prescription medications that are controlled substances are required to obtain proper registration from the Attorney General. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 822(a), 823(f); Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 250-51, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006). Under the CSA, the responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of. controlled substances, which must be for \u201ca legitimate medical purpose,\u201d is on the prescribing practitioner, \u201cbut a corresponding responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a). Thus, pharmacists have a \u201ccorresponding responsibility\u201d to refuse to fill prescriptions that are not issued for a legitimate, medical purpose. See id.\nThe Attorney General has the authority to deny, revoke, or suspend registrations. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 823(f), 824(a). The Attorney General has delegated this authority to the DEA. See United States v. Lippner, 676 F.2d 456, 460 (11th Cir, 1982) (holding that the functions vested in the Attorney General by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention Act were properly delegated to the DEA). When an existing registration is proposed for revocation, the DEA must serve an \u201corder to show cause\u201d on the registrant and give the registrant an opportunity for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) in order to contest the proposed action. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(c).\n' On October 6, 2014, the DEA issued an order to show cause proposing to revoke Jones Pharmacy\u2019s existing registration and to deny SND H\u00e9althcare\u2019s application for registration.- In the order,\u2018the DEA alleged that, from February 2010 to July 2012, Jones Pharmacy \u201crepeatedly failed to ensure that it filled only prescriptions issued for legitimate medical purposes within the usual course of professional practice.\u201d Jones Pharmacy, according to the order, repeatedly ignored \u201cobvious and unresolvable red flags of diversion.\u201d The order also alleged record-keeping violations. According to the order, Jones Pharmacy\u2019s practices warranted denial of SND Healthcare\u2019s application because Jones was the owner and operator of both entities and they were one integrated enterprise.\nPetitioners requested a hearing, which was held before an ALJ in March 2015. At the hearing, the ALJ heard testimony from several persons, including Domingo Gonzales (a DEA diversion investigator), Mary, Crane (a Pharmacy Inspector for the Florida Department of Health), Dr. Tracy Gordon (the government\u2019s expert), Donna Horn (Jones Pharmacy\u2019s expert), and Jones. . . -\nAfter the hearing,- the ALJ issued her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations that the DEA Acting Administrator revoke Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration and- deny SND Healthcare\u2019s application for registration. The ALJ credited the testimony of Gordon, who reviewed over one-hundred prescriptions filled by- Jones Pharmacy between February 2010 -and July 2012 and found that they had one or more \u201cred flags\u201d\u2014indicia that the prescriptions were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose\u2014and should not have been filled. According to Gordon, these red flags included the following: (1) individuals traveling long distances to fill prescriptions; (2) prescriptions for drug \u201ccocktails,\u201d known for their abuse potential, such as oxycodone and Xanax; (3) individuals who arrived together with identical or nearly identical prescriptions; (4) purported pain patients with prescriptions for immediate-release rather than long-acting narcotics; (5) cash purchases; and (6) doctors prescribing outside the scope of their usual practice. The ALJ credited Gordon\u2019s testimony that many of these red flags could not have been resolved by the pharmacists. Accordingly, the ALJ determined that Jones Pharmacy violated its \u201ccorresponding responsibility\u201d by filling controlled-substances prescriptions with unresolved red flags.\nCrediting Gonzales\u2019s testimony and other evidence submitted by the government, the ALJ also found additional indicators that Jones Pharmacy dispensed controlled substances unlawfully. The ALJ cited statistics showing that, from February 2010 to July 2012, Jones Pharmacy\u2019s business was based primarily on sales of controlled substances. In addition, of the more than 3,000 controlled-substance prescriptions filled, 99% were for immediate-release drugs, 89% were for \u201ccocktail\u201d drugs, and \u25a0 93% were paid for in cash. The ALJ noted that these statistics were \u201cunusually high compared to national averages.\u201d For instance, according to a report from the IMS Institute of Healthcare Informatics, the national average for cash sales between 2007 and 2011 was 6%. The ALJ also found that Jones Pharmacy\u2019s high markup on the price per pill\u2014including 415 instances where the markup on the price per pill was over 1,000%\u2014combined with the high rate of cash-based customers indicated diversion because \u201cit elucidates a customer base willing to pay exorbitant prices for a drug the customer could otherwise purchase at a nearby pharmacy for much less.\u201d\nThe ALJ rejected Petitioners\u2019 contentions that Jones was unaware of the concept of \u201cred flags\u201d and that she did not know or have reason to know that the prescriptions filled by Jones Pharmacy were not written for a legitimate medical purpose. The ALJ was unpersuaded by testimony offered by Jones Pharmacy\u2019s expert Horn, who stated that pharmacists were generally unaware of the concept of red flags during the relevant time period. Instead, the ALJ credited the contrary testimony of the government\u2019s expert, Gordon, and concluded that \u201cthe concept of red flags has long been recognized as a reflection of the norms of the pharmacy profession,\u201d so Jones Pharmacy\u2019s purported ignorance was not a credible defense.\nHaving found that the government met its burden of establishing a prima facie case that revocation of Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration was in the public interest, the ALJ then addressed whether Jones Pharmacy put forward sufficient evidence to show that it could be trusted with a registration going forward. The ALJ explained that a registrant must establish two things to rebut the government\u2019s prima facie face: (1) full acceptance of responsibility and (2) remedial measures so that such violations will not happen in the future. Based on Jones\u2019s testimony at the hearing, the ALJ detennined that she had not fully accepted responsibility for Jones Pharmacy\u2019s unlawful dispensing of controlled substances. Citing agency precedent holding that acceptance of responsibility is an independent and essential requirement for rebutting the government\u2019s prima facie case, the ALJ declined to address Jones Pharmacy\u2019s remedial efforts. See, e.g., Holiday CVS, L.L.C., 77 Fed. Reg. 62316, 62323, 2012 WL 4832770 (Oct. 12, 2012).\nPetitioners filed exceptions in May 2015, which the Acting Administrator overruled in a 54-page final order issued on October 31, 2016. Addressing and rejecting many of the arguments we are faced with here, and which we address in more detail below, the Acting Administrator adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommendations. This petition for review followed. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877.\nII.\nWe may set aside the Acting Administrator\u2019s final decision if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). \u201cThe arbitrary and capricious standard is exceedingly deferential.\u201d Defs. of Wildlife v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 733 F.3d 1106, 1115 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). We may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency so long as its conclusions are rational and based on the evidence before it. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, 566 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir. 2009). Nevertheless, we may set aside a decision as \u201carbitrary and capricious when, among other flaws, the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, [or] offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.\u201d High Point, LLLP v. Nat\u2019l Park Serv., 850 F.3d 1185, 1193-94 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Acting Administrator\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877. Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance of the evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 619-90, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966). An administrative agency\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence even if \u201ctwo inconsistent conclusions [could be drawn] from the evidence.\u201d Id.\nIII.\nThe DEA may revoke registration to dispense controlled substances upon a finding that the registrant \u201chas committed such acts as would render his registration ... iriconsistent with the public interest.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(a)(4). Likewise, the DEA may deny registration to dispense controlled substances if such registration is \u201cinconsistent with the public interest.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f).\nSection 823 lists five factors that \u201cshal| be considered\u201d in determining the publif interest. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f). These factors include \u201c[t]he applicant\u2019s experience in dispensing, or conducting research with [respect to controlled substances,\u201d as well &s \u201cCompliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.\u201d Id. \u00a7 823(f)(2), (4). The Acting \u201cAdministrator must consider each factor, though he need not make explicit findings as to each one and can give each factor the weight [he] determines is appropriate.\u201d Akhtar-Zaidi v. Drug Enf't Admin., 841 F.3d 707, 711 (6th Cir. 2016).\nThe government bears the initial burden of proving that registration is inconsistent with the public interest. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.44(d), (e). If the government proves its prima fade case, the burden of proof shifts to the registrant to show why it can be trusted with a registration. Morall v. Drug Enf't Admin., 412 F.3d 165, 174 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\nHere, Petitioners do not dispute that the government met its initial burden of proving that Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration was inconsistent with the public interest. The record supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jones Pharmacy unlawfully filled numerous controlled substance prescriptions that were not issued, for a legitimate medical purpose. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a). As discussed above, the evidence showed that Jones Pharmacy from February 2010 through July 2012' filled over one-hundred prescriptions that had at least one red flag that Jones Pharmacy did not attempt to resolve and that could not have been resolved. The government also put forward other substantial evidence indicating that the controlled substances dispensed by Jones Pharmacy were being diverted for improper use. Accordingly, the agency reasonably determined that revocation of Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration was in the public interest because of Jones Pharmacy\u2019s failure to comply with federal laws relating to controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f)(4).\n.Petitioners instead challenge, as arbitrary and capricious the DEA\u2019s determination that Jones Pharmacy did not prove that' it could be trusted with a registration notwithstanding the prior misconduct. In particular, Petitioners argue that the agency\u2019s finding that Jones, the owner and operator of Jones Pharmacy, did not credibly accept full responsibility is fatally flawed for a number , of reasons. The agency, according to Petitioners, misconstrued Jones\u2019s testimony, relied too heavily on the severity of the misconduct, and unreasonably refused to consider the remedial measures Jones Pharmacy put in place after the time period at issue. Petitioners also contend that the agency\u2019s choice of the most severe sanction\u2014revocation\u2014 was inconsistent with prior agency decisions that either suspended or continued registrations despite more egregious misconduct.\nWe address Petitioners\u2019 arguments in three parts. First, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jones did not credibly accept full responsibility. Second, we hold that the agency\u2019s refusal to consider Jones Pharmacy\u2019s remedial measures does not render its decision arbitrary or capricious in'the circumstances of this case. Finally, we find that the chosen sanction was not arbitrary or capricious.\nA. , Acceptance of Responsibility\nAt the outset, we agree with the other circuits that have addressed this issue that the DEA may properly .consider a registrant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility in determining if registration should be revoked. See MacKay v. Drug Enf't Admin., 664 F.3d 808, 820 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe DEA may properly consider whether a physician admits fault in determining if the physician\u2019s registration should be revoked.\u201d); Hoxie v. Drug Enf't Admin., 419 F.3d 477, 483 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cThe DEA properly considers the candor of the physician and his forthrightness in assisting in the investigation and admitting fault important factors in determining whether the physician\u2019s registration should be- revoked\u201d). If a pharmacy has failed to comply with its responsibilities in the past, it makes sense for the agency to consider whether the pharmacy will change its behavior in the future. MacKay, 664 F.3d at 820; Alra Labs., Inc. v. Drag Enf't Admin., 64 F.3d 460, 462 (7th Cir. 1996) (\u201cAn agency rationally may conclude that past performance is the best predictor of future performance.\u201d). \u201c[T]hat consideration is vital to whether continued registration is in the public interest.\u201d MacKay, 664 F.3d at 820.\nTurning to the facts at hand, substantial evidence supports the DEA\u2019s determination that Jones did not fully accept responsibility for Jones Pharmacy\u2019s unlawful dispensing practices.' The ALJ, who heard Jones testify in person and was therefore in the best position to assess Jones\u2019s credibility, extensively -reviewed Jones\u2019s testimony and found her admission of fault to be equivocal at best. In relevant part, the ALJ summarized Jon\u00e9s\u2019s testimony as follows:\nMs. Jones claimed that she was following her corresponding responsibility [to fill only legitimate prescriptions] as she understood it from 2010-2012 when over a hundred prescriptions that were presented with multiple unresolved red flags were dispensed at Jones Pharmacy. Ms. Jones purported to accept responsibility for Jon\u00e9s Pharmacy\u2019s dispensing practices \"by repeatedly asserting that she did what she knew at the' time, but now she knows she could have done more.\nThe ALJ found, however, that Jones made other statements that demonstrated she \u201cdoes not fully understand her corresponding responsibility even yet today.\u201d For example, Jones indicated on cross-examination that she did not understand that the law required her to make sure that prescriptions were issued for legitimate medical-purposes before filling them. And, significantly, she did not admit that Jones Pharmacy\u2019s past dispensing practices failed to comply with its legal obligations. Thus, the ALJ concluded that Jones did not accept responsibility and that her claimed ignorance about her legal responsibilities, particularly her continued lack of understanding of those responsibilities, was no excuse. The Acting Administrator agreed with the ALJ\u2019s findings after conducting his own review of Jones\u2019s testimony. -\nPetitioners maintain that the agency\u2019s assessment of whether Jones \u00e1ccepted responsibility is fatally flawed for a number of reasons. They insist that Jones accepted responsibility by acknowledging and correcting her mistakes, arid that the \u00c1LJ\u2019s interpretation of her testimony ' was strained and unreasonable. The ALJ, according to' Petitioners, failed to properly consider Jones\u2019s explanation that her misunderstanding of her responsibilities was based in part on what she learned while working at other pharmacies earlier in her career. Petitioners also contend that the ALJ, by drawing a negative inference from Jones\u2019s attempt to explain why she failed to comply with' her corresponding responsibility in the past, imposed a test for acceptance of responsibility \u201cthat can only be met by the most blatant offenders\u201d who knowingly violate their responsibilities.\nPetitioners\u2019 arguments are unpersuasive. To begin with, both the ALJ and the Acting Administrator considered Jones\u2019s explanation of her conduct and reasonably concluded that her' purported confusion or ignorance was not a valid excuse, Jones believed that it was the prescribing physi-dan\u2019s responsibility to issue medically legitimate prescriptions. That may be true, but as a pharmacist registered with the DEA, Jones had a \u201ccorresponding responsibility\u201d not to fill prescriptions that were not issued for a medically legitimate purpose. 21 C.P.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a). The \u201ccorresponding responsibility\u201d rule is not new, see United States v. Hayes, 595 F.2d 258, 261 & n.6 (5th Cir. 1979) (holding that pharmacists have an obligation \u201cnot to fill an order that purports to be a prescription but is not a prescription within the meaning of the statute\u201d), nor is it unreasonable for the DEA to expect a pharmacist entrusted with dispensing highly regulated, addictive, and potentially destructive substances to fully understand her obligations under the law, regardless of prior work experience.\nMoreover, the ALJ credited the government\u2019s evidence that a pharmacist who exercised her corresponding responsibility would not have filled the prescriptions that Jones Pharmacy did from February 2010 to July 2012. The government\u2019s \u2022 evidence reflected that Jones Pharmacy from February 2010 to July 2012 filled at least one-hundred prescriptions with one or more unresolved red flags. In addition, Jones Pharmacy\u2019s business during that time was based substantially on immediate-release \u201ccocktail\u201d pain medications purchased with cash at a high markup on the price per pill.\nAs the Acting Administrator stated, however, \u201cnotwithstanding the obvious and compelling evidence that the prescriptions lacked a legitimate medical purpose, [Jones] continued to deny that the prescriptions were unlawfully dispensed.\u201d To be sure, Jones indicated in her testimony that she was naive, made mistakes, and could and should have done \u201cmore digging\u201d to verify prescriptions. But Petitioners have not identified any clear admission by Jones\u2014regardless of whether she acted knowingly or not\u2014that she understood Jones Pharmacy violated its obligations under the CSA. Instead, Jones reiterated her belief that Jones Pharmacy was fulfilling its responsibilities as she understood them at the time.\nJones\u2019s refusal to admit that Jones Pharmacy\u2019s dispensing practices violated its obligations under federal law reflects that she did not \u201creeognize[ ] the extent of [the] misconduct.\u201d MacKay, 664 F.3d at 820. It also supports the factual finding, critical to both the ALJ\u2019s and the Acting Administrator\u2019s decisions, that Jones did not fully understand her legal obligations as a pharmacist.\nNor was the finding that Jones did not fully understand her obligations under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a) based on some strained interpretation of her testimony. Jones\u2019s statements at the hearing show that she continued to struggle with the idea that pharmacists have an independent duty, apart from the prescribing physician, to ensure that prescriptions are issued for medically legitimate purposes before filling them. For instance, when asked on cross-examination whether she knew \u201cone way or another\u201d if she had a corresponding responsibility, Jones answered, \u201cI did not know that the law said that I had to make sure that prescriptions said it was legitimate, medically legitimate[,]\u201d even \u201csitting here today.\u201d And despite Jones\u2019s assertions to the contrary, pharmacists do not need to practice medicine or independently examine a patient in order to determine in certain cases that a prescription was not issued for a legitimate medical purpose. See Hayes, 595 F.2d at 261 & n.6 (\u201c[A] pharmacist can know that prescriptions are issued for no legitimate medical purpose without his needing to know anything about medical science.\u201d).\nFinally, we reject Petitioners\u2019 argument that the ALJ impermissibly required Jones to admit to knowing misconduct in order to accept responsibility. For starters, the record supports an inference of knowing misconduct, even though Jones maintained that the misconduct was not intentional. More significantly, however, Jones could have maintained that the misconduct was not intentional while, at the same time, recognizing at the Rearing that it nonetheless violated the pharmacy\u2019s obligations under the CSA. We do not know whether the agency would have credited that testimony, of course, but it was reasonable for the agency to conclude that her failure to clearly acknowledge even unintentional misconduct demonstrated a lack of understanding of her legal obligations.\nBecause the record supports the Acting Administrator\u2019s findings that Jones did not acknowledge the prior misconduct and still did not understand the scope of her responsibilities under the CSA, we conclude that the determination that Jones did not fully accept responsibility for Jones Pharmacy\u2019s misconduct was rational and supported by substantial evidence. See Miccosukee Tribe, 566 F.3d at 1264; Consolo, 383 U.S. at 619-90, 86 S.Ct. 1018.\nB. Remedial Measures\nWe acknowledge that Jones Pharmacy appears to have implemented policies to address the misconduct at issue here. According to Petitioners, these remedial efforts'are evidence that they can be trusted with registrations going forward, so it was unreasonable for the DEA to ignore that evidence even if Jones did not unequivocally admit fault; '\nOf course, corrective measures undertaken by a pharmacy -are certainly relevant to whether it can be trusted with a registration to dispense controlled substances. At the same-time, though, the DEA must have confidence that, if the registration is continued, the pharmacy will faithfully comply with its obligations under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f)(4); Holiday CVS, 77 Fed. Reg. at 62345-46. If a pharmacy shows that it does not understand the extent of the past misconduct or its current responsibilities under the law, the DEA rationally could doubt that the pharmacy would faithfully comply in the future with its obligations under the CSA.\nHere, the DEA\u2019s refusal to consider Jones Pharmacy\u2019s remedial measures does not render the decision to revoke its registration arbitrary and-capricious. -The Acting Administrator explained that, based on the scope and duration of misconduct, Jones\u2019s failure to acknowledge that misconduct, and her testimony that she still does not understand the scope of a pharmacist\u2019s obligations under the CSA, he. had no confidence that either entity owned or operated by Jones (Jones Pharmacy and SND Healthcare) would faithfully comply with the CSA. We conclude that the Acting Administrator\u2019s determination was rational and supported by substantial evidence in the record. See Miccosukee Tribe, 566 F.3d at 1264. Accordingly, the Acting Administrator\u2019s decision to revoke Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration as inconsistent with the public interest was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\nC. Choice of Sanction\nPetitioners contend that the Acting Administrator unreasonably recommended the severe sanction of revocation when the DEA has imposed lesser sanctions under equal or more egregious. circumstances.We disagree.\nUnder the APA, the agency\u2019s \u201cchoice of sanction is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d MacKay, 664 F.3d at 820. It is not to be overturned unless it' is \u201cunwarranted in law or without justification in fact.\u201d Butz v. Glover Livestock Comm\u2019n Co., Inc., 411 U.S. 182, 186, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 36 L.Ed.2d 142 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted); MacKay, 664 F.3d at 820; Morall, 412 F.3d at 181. Where, as here, Congress intended to grant the agency significant discretion, \u201cmere unevenness in the application of the sanction does not render its application in a particular case \u2018unwarranted in law.\u2019\u201d Butz, 411 U.S. at 186, 93 S.Ct. 1455; see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f) (directing the DEA to-make registration decisions based on the \u201cpublic interest\u201d). - The agency\u2019s sanction may be set aside, however, if it represents a \u201cflagrant departure\u201d from agency policy and practice. See Chein v. Drug Enf't. Admin., 533 F.3d 828, 835 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\nHere, Petitioners have not shown that the agency\u2019s choice of sanction was unwarranted in law or without justification in fact. The DEA decisions Petitioners rely on are distinguishable because, in each of the decisions, the agency found that the \u2022registrant had rebutted the government\u2019s case by, among other things, admitting fault or expressing remorse. The general pattern of the cited decisions is that a physician engaged in misconduct - attributable in part to alcoholism or drug abuse, sought treatment, did not engage in other misconduct since obtaining treatment, and expressed remorse or otherwise accepted responsibility for the misconduct. See Karen A. Kruger, M.D., 69 Fed. Reg. 7016, 7017-18, 2004 WL 250335 (Feb. 12, 2004); Theodore Neujahr, D.V.M., 65 Fed. Reg. 5680, 5682, 2000 WL 126521 (Feb. 4, 2000); Jimmy H. Conway, Jr., M.D., 64 Fed. Reg. 32271, 32274, 1999 WL 389996 (June 16, 1999); Robert G. Hallermeier, M.D., 62 Fed. Reg. 26818, 26821, 1997 WL 249912 (May 15, 1997).\nPetitioners focus on the past misconduct in these cases, but they do not cite any decision in which the DEA has continued a registration despite finding that the registrant did not fully accept responsibility. Because substantial evidence supports the DEA\u2019s finding that Jones did not accept responsibility for the misconduct in this case, Petitioners have not shown that the agency\u2019s choice of sanction represented a flagrant d\u00e9parture from prior practice. See Chein, 533 -F.3d at 835. Therefore, the agency\u2019s decision to revoke Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration was not arbitrary or capricious.\nIV.\nFinally, Petitioners argue that the ALJ violated their due-process rights by denying discovery of a report prepared by the government\u2019s expert, Tracy Gordon. Petitioners contend that, without the report, they were unable to challenge the expert\u2019s credibility, and the basis of her opinions.\nAs a general matter, a party\u2019s entitlement to discovery in an administrative proceeding is governed by the agency\u2019s own rules. See, e.g., McClelland v. Andrus, 606 F.2d 1278, 1285 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Nevertheless, the agency is bound to ensure that its procedures meet basic due process requirements. Id. at 1285-86. \u201cTherefore, discovery must be granted if m the particular situation a refusal to do so would so prejudice a party as to deny him due process.\u201d Id. at 1286.\nThe Acting Administrator found that Petitioners were not prejudiced because they were \u201cfully apprised of the Government\u2019s theory of the case and the evidence it intended to rely on and [they] had ample opportunity to prepare a defense.\u201d The Acting Administrator further noted that the report was not offered as evidence and that Petitioners were able to fully cross-examine the expert about her testimony and the basis of her opinions at the hearing. Finding Petitioners\u2019 claim of prejudice purely speculative, the Acting Administrator concluded that the ALJ properly denied discovery of the expert\u2019s report.\nHere, we agree with the Acting Administrator that Petitioners have not shown prejudice flowing from the denial of discovery of the expert report. Petitioners claim that they needed the report because it \u201cformed the basis of the DEA\u2019s case,\u201d but as the Acting Administrator found, Petitioners were fully informed of the government\u2019s theory of the case and the evidence that it intended to rely on. Any suggestion that they were unable to dispute the government expert\u2019s findings or her credibility is purely speculative. Accordingly, the agency did not violate Petitioners\u2019 due-process rights by denying discovery of the expert\u2019s report.\nV.\nFor the reasons stated, the DEA Acting Administrator\u2019s decision to revoke Jones Pharmacy\u2019s registration to dispense controlled substance was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The factual findings underlying that decision were supported by substantial evidence, and Petitioners have demonstrated no fatal flaw in the proceedings or- reasoning leading to the revocation decision. See High Point, 850 F.3d at 1193-94. Finally, Petitioners do' not challenge the DEA\u2019s determination that Jones Pharmacy\u2019s practices are an appropriate basis to deny SND Healthcare\u2019s application for registration. Accordingly, we deny Petitioners\u2019\" petition for review.\nPETITION DENIED.\n. In full, the statute directs that the following five factors shall be considered in determining the public interest:\n(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority,\n(2) The applicant\u2019s experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.\n(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.\n(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.\n(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.\n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f),\n. This Court adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions prior to October 1, 1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc).\n. Indeed, the Acting Administrator determined that Jones Pharmacy's \u201cpharmacists either knew or were willfully blind to the fact that the prescriptions were issued in violation of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a).\"\n. We also note that the Acting Administrator found that, even if Jones had credibly accepted full responsibility, he still would have revoked Jones Pharmacy\u2019s- registration because the \"proven misconduct [was] so extensive and egregious.\u201d",
