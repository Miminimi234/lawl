        "text": "TACHA, Circuit Judge.\nThis appeal arose out of an incident in which plaintiff-appellant John Miles, a public high school teacher in Denver, Colorado, was disciplined for statements he made in the classroom. Miles seeks damages and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming the defendant school district violated his first amendment free speech rights. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school. On appeal, Miles argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendant because there are genuine issues of material fact to be determined before the first amendment issue can be decided. Miles also asserts his classroom expression is protected by the first amendment and the letter of reprimand unconstitutionally regulates his speech. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\nI. BACKGROUND\nDuring a ninth grade government class, Miles stated that the quality of the school had declined since 1967. When a student asked for specific examples, Miles replied that in the past the school did not have so many pop cans lying around and school discipline was better. He also commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think in 1967 you would have seen two students making out on the tennis court.\u201d This comment referred to an incident that allegedly had occurred the previous day and was the topic of rumor throughout the school. The rumor was that two students were observed having sexual intercourse on the tennis court during lunch hour. Miles had heard the rumor from a colleague who had heard of the incident from two students claiming to have witnessed it. Miles never sought official confirmation of the rumor before repeating it in class.\nMiles\u2019 comments about the rumor led parents of the alleged participants to complain to the principal. Following meetings with Miles and several other individuals, the principal placed Miles on paid administrative leave for four days. Miles wrote to the principal apologizing for exercising \u201cbad judgment.\u201d The principal conducted an investigation and issued a reprimand letter that stated:\nAfter completing the investigation of the alleged incident in your period 3 class on March 30, 1989, I find it necessary to write you this letter of reprimand. The investigation revealed that you displayed poor judgment in your comment \u201cmaking out\u201d on the tennis court. Informing your students of an alleged incident of one of your tennis players \u201cmaking out\u201d with a female student on the tennis courts during the lunch period was an inappropriate topic for comment in a classroom setting.\nIn the future you will need to refrain from commenting on any items which might reflect negatively on individual members of our student body.\nEight months after his reinstatement, Miles filed this lawsuit claiming that the imposition of paid administrative leave and placement of the letter of reprimand in his file violated and \u201cchilled\u201d his free speech rights. After discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the school and denied Miles\u2019 motion.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review summary judgment orders de novo, using the same standards the district court applies. Osgood v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 848 F.2d 141, 143 (10th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). What material facts are relevant is determined by the substantive law governing a claim. Only factual disputes that affect the outcome of a case under governing law will preclude entry of summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. \u201cFactual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\u201d Id. That both parties have moved for summary judgment does not preclude a finding that a genuine issue of material fact exists. Houghton v. Foremost Fin. Servs. Corp., 724 F.2d 112, 114 (10th Cir.1983).\nB. First Amendment Standard\nIn Mount Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), the Supreme Court established a test for determining whether an adverse employment decision violates a public employee\u2019s first amendment rights. This test requires that an employee show (1) the speech for which he was disciplined was constitutionally protected and (2) the protected speech motivated the adverse employment decision. After an employee has made these showings, the employer has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that she would have made the same decision absent the protected speech. Id. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576; Kirkland v. Northside Indep. School Dist., 890 F.2d 794-, 797, 799 (5th Cir.1989), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 2620, 110 L.Ed.2d 641 (1990).\nIn determining whether Miles has satisfied the initial burden of showing his classroom expression is constitutionally protected, we look to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988). In Hazelwood, student contributors to a newspaper published as part of a journalism class contested the principal\u2019s deletion of material from the newspaper prior to publication. Id. at 261, 108 S.Ct. at 564. Although the Court emphasized that \u201cstudents in the public schools do not \u2018shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,\u2019 \u201d the Court held that educators do not offend the first amendment by exercising editorial control over school-sponsored expression \u201cso long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d Id. at 266, 273, 108 S.Ct. at 567, 571 (quoting Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969)). The Court explained that if school facilities have not been opened for \u201c \u2018indiscriminate use by the general public\u2019 \u201d and the school is not a public forum, then \u201cschool officials may impose reasonable restrictions on the speech of students, teachers, and other members of the school community.\u201d Id. at 267, 108 S.Ct. at 568 (quoting Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Edu cators\u2019Ass\u2019n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 948, 956 n. 7, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983)).\nIn Hazelwood, the Supreme Court determined the extent to which classroom expression is constitutionally protected by first asking whether the school\u2019s student newspaper was a public forum. Id. at 266-70, 108 S.Ct. at 567-68. Similarly, our first inquiry is whether Miles\u2019 ninth-grade classroom is a public forum. As the Supreme Court pointed out in Hazelwood, \u201cpublic schools do not possess all of the attributes of streets, parks, and other traditional public forums that, \u2018time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 267, 108 S.Ct. at 567-68 (quoting Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939)). A podium before a captive audience of public school children is decisively different from a street corner soapbox. The Court in Hazelwood explained that a public forum is not created \u201c \u2018by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 267, 108 S.Ct. at 568 (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Defense & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3449, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985)). If the creation and operation of a school newspaper as part of a journalism class can be devoid of an intent to open a classroom for public discourse, id. at 268-69,108 S.Ct. at 568-69, then an ordinary classroom\u2014 such as the one in which Miles taught\u2014is not a public forum. There is no evidence that school authorities intended to open Miles\u2019 government class for public discourse. Therefore, we conclude that the school \u201c \u2018reserved the forum for its intended purpose\u2019 \u201d of teaching government. Id. at 270, 108 S.Ct. at 569 (quoting Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n, 460 U.S. at 47, 103 .Ct. at 955).\nA recent Eleventh Circuit case supports this conclusion. In Bishop v. Aronov, 926 F.2d 1066 (11th Cir.1991), the Eleventh Circuit, addressing the extent to which a university may restrict a professor\u2019s classroom expression, explained that \u201c[wjhile the [institution] may make its classrooms available for other purposes, we have no doubt that during instructional periods the ... classrooms are \u2018reserved for other intended purposes,\u2019 viz. the teaching of a particular ... course for credit.\u201d Id. at 1071 (quoting Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 267, 108 S.Ct. at 568). Based on this analysis, the court in Bishop held the university classroom was not a public forum and the university could reasonably restrict a professor\u2019s classroom expression. Id. at 1071, 1077.\nAfter determining that the student newspaper in Hazelwood was not a public forum, the Court focused on whether the students\u2019 expression was school-sponsored speech. See id. at 270-73, 108 S.Ct. at 569-71. The Court distinguished its earlier decision in Tinker from the facts at issue in Hazelwood. Tinker addressed whether the first amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student expression not sponsored by the school. Hazelwood, on the other hand, dealt with the authority of school officials \u201cover school-sponsored publications, theatrical productions, and other expressive activities that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.\u201d Id. at 271, 108 S.Ct. at 569. We are convinced that if students\u2019 expression in a school newspaper bears the imprimatur of the school, then a teacher\u2019s expression in the \u201ctraditional classroom setting\u201d also bears the imprimatur of the school. See id. Based on the analysis in Hazel-wood, we conclude Miles\u2019 expression during a ninth-grade government class must be treated as school-sponsored expression in a nonpublic forum for first amendment purposes. Accordingly, we will apply the Ha-zelwood standard for evaluating the actions of school officials related to the regulation of school-sponsored speech.\nBoth in the district court and on appeal, the parties have argued that the issue presented here is controlled by Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), and its progeny. See, e.g., Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987); Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). This line of cases develops a test for balancing the interests of the state as employer in preventing the expression of some statements in the workplace against an employee\u2019s interest in making such statements. See Rankin, 483 U.S. at 388, 107 S.Ct. at 2899; see also Considine v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, 910 F.2d 695, 698-99 (10th Cir.1990). In these cases, the courts have recognized that the state\u2019s interest as an employer in regulating employees\u2019 speech does not differ significantly from interests connected with the regulation of speech outside of the employment context. See Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734. Pickering established a test that first asks whether a public employee\u2019s expression addresses a matter of public concern and then balances that employee\u2019s interest in making the statement with the interests of the government in \u201cpromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.\u201d Rankin, 483 U.S. at 384-85, 388, 107 S.Ct. at 2897, 2899 (quoting Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1735).\nAlthough the Pickering test accounts for the state\u2019s interests as an employer, it does not address the significant interests of the state as educator. The Court in Hazel-wood recognized that a state\u2019s regulation of speech in a public school setting is often justified by peculiar responsibilities the state bears in providing educational services: \u201cto assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach, that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity, and that the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school.\u201d Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 271, 108 S.Ct. at 570. These responsibilities warrant application of the standard adopted in Hazelwood for reviewing regulation of classroom speech rather than the Pickering standard for reviewing regulation of speech in a more general public setting. The concern addressed in Pickering \u2014 the right of an employee to participate as other citizens in debate on public matters \u2014 is simply less forceful when considered \u201c \u2018in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.\u2019 \u201d Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 266, 108 S.Ct. at 567 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506, 89 S.Ct. at 736); see also Note, Public School Teachers and the First Amendment: Protecting the Right to Teach, 65 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 693, 702-04 (1990) (because classroom environment is sui gen-eris, public/private speech distinctions drawn in Pickering and progeny fail in context of teacher\u2019s classroom speech). Because of the special characteristics of a classroom environment, in applying Hazel-wood instead of Pickering we distinguish between teachers\u2019 classroom expression and teachers\u2019 expression in other situations that would not reasonably be perceived as school-sponsored. See Roberts v. Madigan, 921 F.2d 1047, 1056-57 (10th Cir.1990), petition for cert. filed, No. 90-1448 (Mar. 15, 1991); Bishop v. Aronov, 926 F.2d 1066, 1071 (11th Cir.1991); Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1176 (3d Cir.1990).\nThe primary distinction that could be made between the situation in Hazelwood and this case is that Hazelwood involved students\u2019 expression in a secondary school whereas here we are concerned with a secondary school teacher\u2019s classroom expression. In Roberts, 921 F.2d at 1056-57, we reviewed a school\u2019s regulation of a fifth grade teacher\u2019s speech. School officials alleged the teacher\u2019s speech caused a violation of the first amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause. We held there was no reason to distinguish \u201cbetween students and teachers where classroom discussion is concerned.\u201d 921 F.2d at 1057. As in Roberts, we find no reason to distinguish between the classroom discussion of students and teachers in applying Hazelwood here. A school\u2019s interests in regulating classroom speech \u2014 such as \u201cassuring] that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach\u201d and that students are not \u201cexposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity\u201d (Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 271, 108 S.Ct. at 570) \u2014 are implicated regardless of whether that speech comes from a teacher or student.\nC. Application of the Standard\n1. Legitimate Pedagogical Interests\nIn Hazelwood, the Court found that the school\u2019s decision to excise two pages from the newspaper reasonably protected pedagogical interests. The Court noted that these pedagogical interests included preventing speech that was not sufficiently sensitive to students\u2019 privacy interests or that was inappropriate for the maturity level of the adolescent audience. 484 U.S. at 274, 108 S.Ct. at 571. The school here proffers several interests to justify its sanction of Miles\u2019 remark. First, the school states an interest in preventing Miles from using his position of authority to confirm an unsubstantiated rumor. The Supreme Court already has recognized a school\u2019s interest in disassociating itself from speech the school reasonably considers inappropriate to bear its imprimatur. Id. at 260, 108 S.Ct. at 564.\nSecond, the school asserts an interest in ensuring that teacher employees exhibit professionalism and sound judgment. In Koch v. City of Hutchinson, 847 F.2d 1436, 1450 (10th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 909, 109 S.Ct. 262, 102 L.Ed.2d 250 (1988), we recognized a public employer\u2019s interest in ensuring its employee\u2019s \u201cability and competence to perform his or her job.\u201d Clearly, professionalism and sound judgment contribute to the competent performance of a teacher\u2019s job. Indeed, as Miles himself reminds us,\nThe process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not confined to books, the curriculum, and the civics class; schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized social order. Consciously or otherwise, teachers ... demonstrate the appropriate form of civil discourse and political expression by their conduct and deportment in and out of class.\nThird, the school states an interest in providing an educational atmosphere where teachers do not make statements about students that embarrass those students among their peers. This interest is related to two concerns the Court approved in Ha-zelwood. There, the Court held a school could regulate school-sponsored speech to protect the privacy interests of unnamed but potentially identifiable parties mentioned in the article. 484 U.S. at 274-75, 108 S.Ct. at 571-72. The Court also permitted school officials to prevent the publication of allegations against named parties without giving them a fair chance to refute the allegations. Id. at 275, 108 S.Ct. at 572.\nThe interests asserted by the school in this case clearly are legitimate pedagogical interests. Thus, the only remaining question under Hazelwood is whether the actions taken by the school are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical interests.\n2. The Relation of the School\u2019s Actions to Pedagogical Interests\nThe school in this case put Miles on paid administrative leave during the investigation and placed a letter of reprimand in his file. The brief administrative leave allowed the school to investigate the incident and to disassociate itself from the speech; thus, the leave was directly tied to the interest of avoiding the appearance that the comment was sponsored by the school or in any way reflected the views of the school administration. The letter of reprimand stated only that Miles should refrain from the same kinds of comments as those involved in the incident. The letter was specific in articulating the school\u2019s interest: it admonished a teacher to refrain from commenting on items that would reflect negatively on individual members of the student body. That portion of the reprimand \u2014 particularly when viewed in the context of the incident for which Miles knew he was being reprimanded \u2014 serves the precise legitimate pedagogical interests articulated by the school. We hold that the school acted reasonably under the circumstances of this case where the actions taken were directly related to the school\u2019s legitimate pedagogical interests.\nMiles\u2019 argument regarding the vagueness and overbreadth of the reprimand invites us to tailor the language or to pick an appropriate action for the school. We decline to do so. Having found that the school had legitimate pedagogical interests and that the actions taken were reasonably-related to those interests, we will not interfere with the authority of the school officials to select among alternative forms of discipline. We will protect appropriate constitutional interests. We should not and will not run the schools.\n3. Immaterial Facts\nMiles argues that factual disputes remain regarding whether he named the student, whether the rumor about the alleged incident was true, whether the incident was generally known in the school, and whether other students knew who the participants were. Miles\u2019 argument is without merit. The factual issues Miles raises are not material under the Hazelwood standard. See Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 273, 108 S.Ct. at 571. Therefore summary judgment is appropriate based on Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nD. Academic Freedom\nFinally, Miles contends the school\u2019s actions violate his first amendment academic freedom rights. The Supreme Court has recognized a university\u2019s institutional right to academic freedom. See, e.g., Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 311-12, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2759-60, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (citing Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1218, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)). At least one lower court has recognized an individual right to academic freedom under limited circumstances in the university setting. See Parate v. Isibor, 868 F.2d 821, 830-31 (6th Cir.1989) (university professor\u2019s right of academic freedom not violated because the dean\u2019s interference did not cast \u201cpall of orthodoxy\u201d over professor\u2019s classroom expression). However, the caselaw does not support Miles\u2019 position that a secondary school teacher has a constitutional right to academic freedom. See Board of Educ., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 920, 102 S.Ct. 2799, 2835, 73 L.Ed.2d 435 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (state as educator subject to fewer strictures when regulating speech in primary and secondary schools than university; school officials may determine that particular subject is not suitable for education of secondary school children); Adams v. Campbell City School Dist., 511 F.2d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir.1975) (teacher does not have \u201cunlimited liberty as to structure and content of the courses, at least at the secondary level\u201d); see also Bishop, 926 F.2d at 1075 (finding no support for individual academic freedom right of university professor); Byrne, Academic Freedom: A \u201cSpecial Concern of the First Amendment\", 99 Yale L.J. 251, 255 (1989) (\u201cconstitutional academic freedom should primarily insulate the university in core academic affairs from interference from the state\u201d). The school\u2019s mild restrictions of Miles\u2019 classroom expression here simply do not threaten to \u201ccast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.\u201d Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967). We find no merit in the argument that Miles has a constitutional right \u2014 based on academic freedom or something else \u2014 that protects his substantiation of a rumor in a classroom setting.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nThe school has identified legitimate educational interests it sought to protect and has shown that its actions are reasonably related to those interests. Miles has failed to raise a genuine factual dispute on either of these issues. Because Miles has not shown his classroom comments under these particular circumstances were constitutionally protected, we do not reach the other two requirements under Mount Healthy. We AFFIRM.",
