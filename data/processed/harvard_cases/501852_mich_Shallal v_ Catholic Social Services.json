      {
        "text": "Cavanagh, J.\nWe granted leave to appeal in this case to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing Janette Shallal\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act. MCL 15.361 et seq.; MSA 17.428(1) et seq. We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the dismissal.\nI\nDefendant Catholic Social Services of Wayne County (css) is a nonprofit social service agency that provides a wide range of services. Plaintiff Shallal worked for css as an adoption department supervisor under a termination \u201cfor cause\u201d employment contract. This suit arises out of her claim against CSS for retaliatory discharge.\nIn late 1986, the css Board of Directors appointed defendant Thomas D. Quinn to the position of css president. Quinn\u2019s alleged lack of expertise prompted some members of the staff to write a letter to the board opposing the appointment. Despite the opposition, Quinn began his presidency in January 1987.\nApproximately one year into Quinn\u2019s tenure, allegations arose that Quinn was drinking on the job and misusing agency funds in violation of agency rules. Shallal discussed the need to report to her supervisor and other staff members. She also discussed her concerns about Quinn\u2019s violations with an honorary CSS-Board Member, Mr. Ryan. Ryan suggested that Shallal report Quinn\u2019s violations to the board and to accrediting bodies, presumably in the dss. Shallal never took action, however, because she feared that her job would be jeopardized.\nBefore her employment with CSS was terminated, Shallal supervised the adoption of a baby, Ray Glover. Soon after the placement, Shallal learned that Ray\u2019s former foster mother had visited Ray and reported seeing bruises on his face, neck, and hands. In retrospect, it appears that Shallal should have reported the allegation to the dss. A case worker did check on Ray within thirty days of the allegation; however, no official action was taken, there being only minor scratches visible on Ray. Several weeks later, however, Ray was rushed to the hospital, nearly dead from \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d Today, he remains in a chronic vegetative state with severe, permanent brain damage.\nWhen Shallal notified the DSS about Ray\u2019s injuries, it investigated and cited CSS with violations of several agency rules and regulations. It criticized Shallal for her inadequate response to the first report of abuse, her approval of an inadequate adoption home evaluation, and her failure to coordinate house visits. The DSS faulted Shallal for placing improper emphasis on race in the placement process. The report was equally critical of CSS, listing several institutional failures.\nAs is their practice, DSS officials met with defendant Quinn before issuing a formal written report on April 19, 1991. They did not specifically recommend Shallai\u2019s dismissal. Shallal alleges that, in the past, comparable employee errors did not result in discharge.\nAfter the meeting with DSS officials, Quinn called Shallal into his office. The ensuing discussion became heated. Shallal stated her intention to report Quinn\u2019s abuses of alcohol and agency funds if he failed to, in her words, \u201cstraighten up.\u201d\nQuinn decided to discharge Shallal, citing the DSS report as support. He ordered Timothy Kluka, plaintiff\u2019s direct supervisor, to fire her. Kluka refused, feeling he had insufficient information to give as a reason to dismiss. He also believed Shallal\u2019s termination would have negative implications for the staff and the agency. Instead, Kluka resigned from his position that day.\nOn April 24, 1991, Patrick Heron dismissed plaintiff for gross misconduct and negligence in supervising the adoption of Baby Ray. Quinn has since resigned from his position as president.\nPlaintiff filed this suit on July 22, 1991, alleging a breach of her employment contract and violation of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act. With respect to the latter claim, the trial court found that any threats plaintiff made to report Quinn were contingent on his continued violation. It also found no evidence plaintiff was \u201cabout to\u201d report a violation. It then granted summary disposition for defendants under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed in a two-to-one decision. It reasoned that the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act requires a plaintiff to be \u201cnear to an action, near to the performance, or in readiness to report the alleged misconduct of defendant Quinn.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 28, 1995 (Docket No. 155006), slip op at 1. The Court of Appeals found that plaintiff failed to satisfy the immediacy requirement, because her threat was contingent on the perpetuation of Quinn\u2019s alleged misconduct. The Court concluded as a matter of law that no reasonable person could have believed that plaintiff was about to report a violation for purposes of the act.\nn\nThe party bringing a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) bears the initial burden of supporting its position with affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence. Quinto v Cross & Peters Co, 451 Mich 358, 362; 547 NW2d 314 (1996). The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Id.\nThe trial court views affidavits and other documentary evidence supporting a (C)(10) motion in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Quinto at 362. A party is entitled to summary disposition if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at trial. Id.\nTo determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists, the test is \u201cwhether the kind of record which might be developed, giving the benefit of reasonable doubt to the opposing party, would leave open an issue upon which reasonable minds might differ.\u201d [Skinner v Square D Co, 445 Mich 153, 162; 516 NW2d 475 (1994), quoting Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co v Stark, 437 Mich 175, 184-185; 468 NW2d 498 (1991).]\nDefendants offered deposition testimony to support their motion for summary disposition. Consequently, in order to survive the motion, Shallal had to provide documentary evidence establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\nm\nSection 2 of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act provides in part:\nAn employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because the employee, or a person acting on behalf of the employee, reports or is about to report, verbally or in writing, a violation or a suspected violation of a law or regulation .... [MCL 15.362; MSA 17.428(2) (emphasis added).]\nTo establish a prima facie case, it must be shown that (1) the plaintiff was engaged in protected activity as defined by the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, (2) the plaintiff was discharged, and (3) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the discharge. Terzano v Wayne Co, 216 Mich App 522, 526; 549 NW2d 606 (1996).\nIt is undisputed that Shallal was discharged on April 24, 1991. Therefore, to meet her prima facie burden at the hearing, she needed only to provide facts from which one could reasonably conclude that (1) she had been engaged in protected activity and (2) the activity was causally connected to her discharge.\nAn employee is engaged in protected activity under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act who has reported, or is about to report, a suspected violation of law to a public body. It is undisputed that Shallal did not report a suspected violation of law to a public body before her discharge. Hence, Shallal had the burden of establishing that a question of fact existed regarding whether she was \u201cabout to\u201d report Quinn\u2019s violations to a public body. Our task is to determine if plaintiff met her burden. To accomplish that, we examine the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act.\nThe cardinal rule of all statutory construction is to identify and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, 448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995). The first step in discerning intent is to examine the language of the statute in question. Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v Hill, 431 Mich 449; 430 NW2d 636 (1988). We read the language according to its ordinary and generally accepted meaning. Judicial construction is authorized only where it lends itself to more than one interpretation. Frame v Nehls, 452 Mich 171; 550 NW2d 739 (1996). We also consider that remedial statutes, such as the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, are to be liberally construed, favoring the persons the Legislature intended to benefit. Dudewicz v Norris Schmid, Inc, 443 Mich 68, 77; 503 NW2d 645 (1993).\nA plain meaning reading of the act shows that an employee \u201cabout to\u201d report receives the same level of protection as one who has reported to a public body. The plain language also restricts recovery under the act by requiring a nonreporting employee to establish being \u201cabout to\u201d report by offering clear and convincing evidence. MCL 15.363(4); MSA 17.428(3)(4). The face of the statute, however, does not explain what constitutes \u201cabout to\u201d report, thereby lending itself to more than one interpretation. Consequently, we examine the purpose of the act for guidance.\nThis Court has noted that the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act\u2019s main purpose is to alleviate \u201cthe inability to combat corruption or criminally irresponsible behavior in the conduct of government or large businesses.\u201d Dudewicz at 75. While employees are often in the best position to report violations of law, they are too frequently reluctant to do so for fear of retribution. Id. The act prohibits future employer reprisals against whistleblowing employees for the purpose of encouraging employees to report violations. Id.\nLegislative analysis indicates that the \u201cabout to\u201d report language was added to the bill to protect conscientious employees who intended to, but were discharged in retaliation before they could, report. House Legislative Analysis, HB 5088, 5089, February 5, 1981. Webster\u2019s defines \u201cabout\u201d as \u201con the verge of\u201d when followed by an infinitive, such as \u201cto leave,\u201d or in this case, \u201cto report.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, 1995, p 4.\nThe analysis also evidences a legislative recognition that the \u201cabout to\u201d report language was a potential source of controversy. Id. In fact, legislative opposition to the bill questioned:\nHow does one establish that a person was \u201cabout to\u201d do something? This language is an open invitation for disgruntled employees or former employees to claim that their treatment by an employer has been illegal. It could become difficult or impossible to fire or discipline employees. [House Legislative Analysis, HB 5088, 5089, February 5, 1981, p 2.]\nIn response, the bill\u2019s proponents noted:\nThere is never any foolproof way of guarding against false claims of discrimination, but it would be unreasonable to deny protection to the conscientious because that shelter might be used by the unscrupulous. House Bill 5089 does contain significant safeguards against employee abuse of its provisions by requiring that an action be commenced within 90 days of the occurrence of the alleged violation and by specifying that an employee who claims to have been about to report a violation must give clear and convincing evidence to this intention. [Id. ]\nThus, the implication is that the language of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act intentionally reduces employee protection the more removed the employee is from reporting to a public body.\nIV\nPlaintiff Shallal alleges that she was engaged in protected activity under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act because she was \u201cabout to\u201d report Quinn\u2019s abuse of alcohol and agency funds to the dss. She asserts that Quinn\u2019s activities violated DSS agency rules. She supports her claim with deposition testimony that describes her confronting Quinn with his violations. She also provides entries from her personal calendar that identify by date the people she spoke with about her desire to report Quinn.\nShallal alleges that Quinn called her to his office on April 17, 1991, following his meeting with dss officials. When the discussion became heated, she told Quinn:\n[l]t\u2019s all your fault This agency is going down the drain because you\u2019re the one that has no interest, has no commitment. You\u2019re so busy drinking and misusing money that you don\u2019t care.\nAnd if you don\u2019t straighten up ... I will report [you] to the department, to the board, anybody, everybody.\nAfter her termination, Shallal stated that she tried to retrieve what \u201cactually happened\u201d from her memory. She also said that she had \u201cmade some mental notes of conversations and dates . . . that [stuck] out in [her] mind.\u201d\nShallal supported her mental notes with calendar entries, which she read at her deposition.\nOn January 25, I went to lunch with Ted Goldberg and my dictation says, \u201ctalked about reporting and confronting Tom.\u201d\nOn February 21, it says, \u201ctalked to Charlie G. about reporting Tom. We\u2019re all enablers.\u201d\nOn March 22,1 have \u201cscheduled lunch with Mary Therese Lamanek.\u201d That was the lunch she and I discussed \u2014 I did not have any notation .... Basically [we talked] about problems in the agency, reporting Tom; we can\u2019t let this thing go on and on.\n* * *\nOn April 10, when Tim and I were coming back from meeting in Lansing, the federation meeting, I have notated, \u201ctalked to T.K. about Tom wanting to fire me. We need to report him.\u201d And I had slash (/) \u201cdss.\u201d\nIn its decision, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the trial court properly dismissed Shallal\u2019s retaliatory discharge as a matter of law.\n[N]o reasonable person could conclude that plaintiff was near to an action, near to the performance, or in readiness to report the alleged misconduct of defendant Quinn. . . . Plaintiff\u2019s words, \u201cif you don\u2019t straighten up ... I will report [you],\u201d belie any sense of immediacy. [Slip op at 1.]\nThe Court further noted that Shallal\u2019s deposition testimony indicated that \u201cshe threatened to report him if he did not shape up, thereby giving him an opportunity to change and avoid being reported.\u201d Id.\nThe employee bears the burden of establishing that being about to act on a belief that a report to a public body was warranted. The employee\u2019s proof, however, need not consist of a concrete action to satisfy the \u201cabout to\u201d report element. See Chandler v Dowell Schlumberger, Inc, 214 Mich App 111, 120; 542 NW2d 310 (1995).\nWe hold that the plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act. However, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that plaintiff\u2019s statement, \u201cif you don\u2019t straighten up ... I will report [you],\u201d coupled with her other actions, does not satisfy the \u201cabout to report\u201d language under the act. Rather, we hold that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and her firing because she knew that she was going to be fired before she confronted her supervisor; thus, she used the information she had about the defendant\u2019s illegal activities as a guise to force the defendant to allow her to keep her job.\nv\nUnlike whistleblower statutes in other jurisdictions, Michigan provides unique protection to its citizens because it does not require the plaintiff to have actually reported the suspected violation. For example, \u201cthe federal whistleblower statute requires that a plaintiff pursue administrative remedies, including filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel. This step is mandatory. 5 USC 1214(a)(3).\u201d Williams v West, unpublished opinion of the northern district of California, decided July 23, 1996 (Docket No. C-95-1516 SI), 1996 US Dist LEXIS 10654 *14 (ND Cal, 1996). Other jurisdictions only protect public employees. See, e.g., Clark v Modern Group Ltd, 9 F3d 321 (CA 3, 1993) (the whistleblower protection statute only applies to public employees in Pennsylvania). However, as we have previously noted, the plain meaning of Michigan\u2019s Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act shows that an employee \u201cabout to report\u201d receives the same level of protection as one who has actually reported to a public body.\nThe dissent states that \u201cno reasonable jury could conclude from the fact that plaintiff discussed reporting Quinn and threatened him, that she had decided actually to do it and do it in the near future.\u201d Post at 627. We disagree. Plaintiff\u2019s conditional threat to her employer was credible evidence that she had finally decided that she was going to report him. Giving her employer the opportunity to correct his behavior does not in any way affect whether she had formed the requisite intent to report her supervisor. In fact, her threat furthered the public policy goal of the statute, which is to combat the corruption or criminally irresponsible behavior of employers. A plaintiff should not be required to say \u201cmagic words\u201d in order to reap the protections of the statute. It should be sufficient that plaintiff actually threatened to report her employer.\n\u201c[W]histleblower statute[s] [are] analogous to antiretaliation provisions of other employment discrimination statutes and therefore should receive treatment under the standards of proof of those analogous statutes. [Courts] agreef] that the policies underlying these similar statutes warrant parallel treatment here, and other courts faced with like issues have similarly responded.\u201d Rouse v Farmers State Bank of Jewell, Iowa, 866 F Supp 1191, 1204 (ND Iowa, 1994). By analogy, the public policy concerns of whistleblower statutes have been echoed in the similar area of federal law under the False Claims Act, 31 USC 3730. This section of the act \u201cmight properly be characterized as the \u2018whistleblower\u2019 provisions of the false claims statute.\u201d Southern California Rapid Transit Dist v Los Angeles Co Superior Court, 30 Cal App 4th 713, 724; 36 Cal Rptr 2d 665 (1994). The False Claims Act (or \u201cqui tam\u201d violations) have existed in various forms since 1863. They empower private citizens to bring suits on behalf of the government against persons who knowingly present false or fraudulent claims to the government for approval or payment. The act is \u201cdesigned to encourage citizens to ferret out fraud on the federal government . . . .\u201d Mikes v Strauss, 889 F Supp 746, 751 (SD NY, 1995).\nTo sustain an action under the False Claims Act, the plaintiff must prove \u201c1) that she engaged in conduct protected under the statute, 2) that defendants were aware of her conduct, and 3) that she was terminated in retaliation for her conduct.\u201d Id. at 752. Under the first element, \u201cplaintiff need not have actually filed suit under the fca to receive the protection accorded by [the statute].\u201d Id. Observing the defendant\u2019s illegal action \u201cand confronting defendants with her observations\u201d is sufficient to demonstrate that the plaintiff was engaged in a protected activity. Id. The same should be true of this case. Plaintiff observed the illegal action and confronted defendant with her observations.\nEven under the second element, the plaintiff in this case would have satisfied the requirements for sustaining a qui tarn suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has adopted a strict approach which requires that \u201cbefore termination the employee must expressly accuse the employer of defrauding the government or threaten a qui tarn action based thereon . . . .\u201d Id. at 753. Other courts have not required the plaintiff to meet such strict standards. For example the Mikes court has stated:\n[A]n employee must supply sufficient facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the employee was discharged because of activities which gave the employer reason to believe that the employee was contemplating a qui tarn action against it. To insist upon an express or even an implied threat of such action would impose a requirement which is wholly unrealistic in an employment context. Despite the protection afforded by [the statute] \u2014 of which most employees are doubtless unaware \u2014 those who tell their employers they are preparing to sue them on behalf of a defrauded government can scarcely expect a long and happy tenure. [Id.]\nHowever, under either approach, plaintiff in ornease would have met the requirements for a qui tarn action under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act. Plaintiff made an express threat to her employer that she would report him if he did not shape up. This clearly evidences an intent to report, and thus satisfies the \u201cabout to report\u201d language of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act.\nThe dissent states that the express threat to her employer was insufficient in part because she did not take her supervisor\u2019s advice and actually report because \u201cshe feared for her job,\u201d she \u201cdid not call her state representative,\u201d she did not \u201creport after her termination,\u201d nor did she specifically state that she had \u201cdecided to report Quinn.\u201d Post at 625. Not one of these things is required by the statute. Confronting a supervisor with a threat of a report serves to promote the public policy of whistleblower statutes. Certainly such a threat should demonstrate that the employee has an actual intent to report the violation. As stated by the Supreme Court of Texas:\nDissenters and whistleblowers rarely win popularity contests or Dale Carnegie awards. They are frequently irritating and unsettling. These qualities, however, do not necessarily make their views wrong or unhelpful. . . . [T]he employee\u2019s report should not be limited to some outside official .... [I]ntemal reporting of wrongdoing should be encouraged, so that an employer may have an opportunity to investigate and remedy problems before involving outside authorities. . . . The underlying policy goals to avert harm to the public may be just as effectively served by communication within an organization .... [Winters v Houston Chronicle Publishing Co, 795 SW2d 723, 733 (Tex, 1990) (Doggett, J., concurring).]\nWe recognize that if an employee chooses to proceed with an action she must report the violation to a public body. However, the statute is very clear that conduct short of actually reporting is also protected if it can be demonstrated that the employee was \u201cabout to\u201d report. The dissent would punish the plaintiff for not actually reporting the violation, even though the Michigan statute does not require such action. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has held that in order to prove a prima facie case of retaliation under a whistleblower statute, the plaintiff must \u201cspecifically . . . show [] that the employer had knowledge of the employee\u2019s protected activity . . . .\u201d Rouse, supra at 1206. Under this strict standard, plaintiff\u2019s threat would be considered protected activity.\nTherefore, on the basis of these facts, we hold that plaintiffs express threat to the wrongdoer that she would report him if he did not straighten up, especially coupled with her other actions, was more than ample to conclude that reasonable minds could find that she was \u201cabout to report\u201d a suspected violation of the law to the DSS.\nVI\nHowever, proving plaintiff was engaged in protected activity does not end the inquiry. We hold that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between her actions and her firing. Many courts have held that a plaintiff is precluded from recovering under a whistleblower statute when the employee acts in bad faith. See, e.g., Melchi v Burns Int\u2019l Security Services, Inc, 597 F Supp 575 (ED Mich, 1984), Wolcott v Champion Int\u2019l Corp, 691 F Supp 1052 (WD Mich, 1987). The primary motivation of an employee pursuing a whistleblower claim \u201cmust be a desire to inform the public on matters of public concern, and not personal vindictiveness.\u201d Id. at 1065.\nWhere, however, an employee . . . keeps the matter quiet for more than a year, eventually revealing it not to the appropriate authorities or even to others for the purpose of preventing public injury, but rather for some other limited and private purpose, however laudable that purpose may appear to the employee, no such protection is afforded. [Otherwise] we would be discouraging disclosure and correction of unlawful or improper acts by encouraging employees to \u201cgo along\u201d and then keep quiet reserving comment or disclosure until a time best suited to the advancement of their own interests. [Id. at 1065-1066.]\nLike Wolcott, it is clear that plaintiff used her own situation to extort defendant not to fire her. While not all circumstances potentially giving rise to an extorsive motive will preclude summary disposition, see LaFond v General Physics Services Corp, 50 F3d 165 (CA 2, 1995), in this case, no reasonable juror could conclude that plaintiff threatened to report Quinn out of an altruistic motive of protecting the public. Furthermore, it is clear that the decision to fire plaintiff was made before her threat to Quinn and that plaintiff knew of this decision as evidenced by her calendar entry, which stated, \u201ctalked to T.K. about Tom wanting to fire me. We need to report him.\u201d Plaintiff cannot use the whistleblowers\u2019 act as a shield against being fired where she knew she was going to be fired before threatening to report her supervisor. To hold otherwise \u201cwould encourage other employees to hold off blowing the whistle until it becomes most advantageous for them to do so. Plaintiff has offered no evidence which suggests that the Michigan Legislature intended the Whistleblowers Act to be used as an offensive weapon by disgruntled employees.\u201d Wolcott, supra at 1066.\nvn\nFor these reasons, we hold that plaintiff presented sufficient facts upon which reasonable minds could conclude that she was \u201cabout to report\u201d a suspected violation. However, because she used the threat of reporting defendant to force him to allow her to keep her job, no reasonable juror could conclude there was a causal connection between her firing and the protected activity. Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nBoyle, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.\nFor example, the State of Michigan, through the Department of Social Services, licenses CSS to receive children for placement in private family homes for foster care or adoption. MCL 722.111(c); MSA 25.358(ll)(c).\nAfter his appointment, the signers of the letter became known as \u201cQuinn\u2019s hit list.\u201d Shallal was one of the signers. She claims a striking correlation exists between employees who signed the letter and those who were later terminated, forced to retire, demoted or transferred during the course of Quinn\u2019s presidency.\nStaff members learned that Quinn and his family attended a conference in Hawaii, paid for by CSS. Quinn allegedly had a small refrigerator in his office that he stocked with beer and wine. He also charged allegedly excessive amounts on his agency credit card at a local restaurant and pub.\nShallal met with DSS officials after her termination. However, she did not report Quinn\u2019s drinking or abuse of agency funds.\nThe dissenting judge argued that plaintiff\u2019s testimony created a question of fact regarding whether she was about to report a violation.\nShallal did not report Quinn\u2019s alleged violations after her termination, either.\nMalin, Protecting the whistleblower from retaliatory discharge, 16 U Mich J L Ref 277, 305 (1983).\n\u201cQui tam\u201d is abbreviation of Latin phrase \u201cqui tam pro domino rege quam pro si ipso in hac parte sequitur\u201d meaning \u201cWho sues on behalf of the King as well as for himself.\u201d It is an action brought by an informer, under a statute which establishes a penalty for the commission or omission of a certain act, and provides that the same shall be recoverable in a civil action, part of the penalty to go to any person who will bring such action and the remainder to the state or some other institution. It is called a \u201cqui tam action\u201d because the plaintiff states that he sues as well for the state as for himself. [Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 1251.]\nEven under the dissent\u2019s reasoning, plaintiff has met her burden of demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether she possessed an actual intent to report defendant\u2019s violations. The dissent states that \u201cthe actions [to which] I refer . . . , significant by their absence, represent the state of the plaintiff\u2019s mind. If she had taken any of them, it would serve to convince a jury that she was about to report.\u201d Post at 625.\nIn this case, there were many things \u201cin addition\u201d to her express threat to report that demonstrate that there is a triable question of fact regarding whether she intended to report Quinn. While it is true that plaintiff had thought about reporting him for years, a reasonable jury could conclude that her mere thoughts changed to actual intent to report just before her confronting Quinn: (1) she discussed the violations with her supervisor and honorary board member, (2) she discussed reporting her supervisor with her co-workers, as evidenced by her diary entries, and (3) she wrote in her calendar, \u201cWe need to report him . . . /DSS.\u201d What more could plaintiff have done to make it clear that she was about to report? Contrary to the implications of the dissent, the law does not require her to \u201cactually report.\u201d Id. at 624. The law does not require that she \u201ccall her state representative to learn where to report the abuse.\u201d Finally, the law does not require that she \u201cstate[] that she had decided to report Quinn\u2019 soon.

        "text": "Kelly, J.\n(concurring in part and dissenting in part). I agree with the majority that the plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act. However, I disagree that the evidence advanced to convince the factfinder that plaintiff was about to report suffices to establish a jury question.\ni\nPlaintiff Shallal alleges that she was engaged in protected activity under the act because she was \u201cabout to\u201d report defendant Quinn\u2019s abuse of alcohol and agency funds to the Department of Social Services. She asserts that Quinn\u2019s activities violated DSS agency rules. She supports her claim with deposition testimony that describes her confronting Quinn with his violations. She also provides entries from her personal calendar that identify by date the people she spoke with about her desire to report Quinn.\nI would hold that Shallal failed to present evidence that she had formed a definite intent to report to a public body in the near future. Without that intent, she could hardly be found to have been \u201cabout to\u201d report, unless she was \u201cabout to\u201d do it without knowing it.\nShallal established that she learned of Quinn\u2019s abuses and recognized the need to correct the problem. However, recognizing that something must be done, and deciding without contingencies to do it, are distinct steps. What constitutes \u201cabout to\u201d report is a function of the facts and circumstances of each case. Normally, the determination will involve a plaintiff\u2019s state of mind and will be a question for the jury. However, as the Court of Appeals noted, there are cases in which the plaintiffs proofs are so lacking on this element that no reasonable juror could conclude that plaintiff was about to report. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 28, 1995 (Docket No. 155006), slip op at 1. I see this as one of those cases. Like well-intentioned New Year\u2019s resolutions never acted upon, Shallal\u2019s showing that she recognized the offenses, and desired to report them if they did not end, are not evidence that she was \u201cabout to\u201d report.\nI am unpersuaded by plaintiff\u2019s reliance on Lynd v Adapt, Inc, 200 Mich App 305; 503 NW2d 766 (1993). Rather, I believe that Shallal\u2019s actions are distinguishable from those of the employee in Lynd. Betty Lynd presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that she had definitely decided to report employer misdeeds in the near future. The Court of Appeals reasoned that she\nmade several attempts to remedy what she believed to be improper practices by reporting the alleged abuse to her supervisors and the organization\u2019s board of directors. She also contacted her state representative to leam whom she should contact to report the suspected abuse. [Id. at 306.]\nThe Court considered the fact that she reported the employer misdeeds after her termination. However, it correctly noted that an employee need not actually report after termination to be covered under the act\u2019s \u201cabout to\u201d report language. Id.\nWhereas Betty Lynd reported to her supervisor and her employer\u2019s board of directors, Janette Shallal merely discussed what could be done about Quinn with her supervisor and an honorary board member. She did not take the latter\u2019s advice to report Quinn because she feared for her job. Perhaps she was not \u201cabout to\u201d report, for the same reason. Unlike Lynd, Shallal did not call her state representative to learn where to report the abuse. Although it is not dispositive, Shallal did not report after her termination, either, as did Lynd. Finally, she never stated that she had decided to report Quinn in the near future.\nThe majority disagrees with my finding insufficient evidence because plaintiff failed to report before or after termination, to get information on how to report or even decide to report soon. Ante at 619-620. The majority points out that the statute does not require any of these actions. Id.\nCertainly, the statute requires no specific action. However, the actions I refer to, significant by their absence, represent the state of the plaintiff\u2019s mind. If she had taken any of them, it would serve to convince a jury that she was about to report. Any of them would have been evidence that Shallal had formed the intention to report to a public body with immediacy.\nAs the majority notes, the common meaning of \u201cabout to\u201d suggests a sense of immediacy. Ante at 612. (\u2018'Webster\u2019s defines \u2018about\u2019 as \u2018on the verge of\u2019 when followed by an infinitive . . . .\u201d) None of the actions Shallal did take indicates an intention to report soon to a public body. Thus, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s inference that my position reads into the statute something that is not there.\nI find the majority\u2019s analogy to the False Claims Act unpersuasive. As the majority notes, what constitutes protected activity under that act differs from what constitutes protected activity under the Whistle-blowers\u2019 Protection Act. Ante at 618. Under the fca, evidence that an employee observed and confronted a defendant with her observations suffices to get the case to a jury. Id. Under the whistleblowers\u2019 act, however, there must be evidence that the employee reported or was about to report.\nSince the actions required of employees under the fca are clearly less stringent than those required under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, the majority\u2019s analogy loses force. If the Michigan Legislature intended to protect an employee who confronts an employee, as the FCA does, it could have done so. The New York Legislature wrote a stronger whistle-blowers\u2019 law than ours. But the Michigan Legislature has seen fit to require either actual reporting or proof by clear and convincing evidence that an employee was \u201cabout to report.\u201d It has refused to bring within the protection of the act an employee who discusses reporting and who approaches the employer and threatens to report, but takes no further action. Perhaps this is regrettable and should be remedied. However, the lawmaking that is appropriate is legislative, not judicial.\nIn conclusion, no reasonable jury could conclude from the fact that plaintiff discussed reporting Quinn and threatened him, that she had decided actually to do it and do it in the near future. Without some evidence of that decision, plaintiff could not have been \u201cabout to\u201d report. Therefore, I conclude that the trial judge properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\nn\nI would not reach the issue whether a causal relationship existed between the discharge and the protected activity. Rather, I would dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claim because she failed to present evidence sufficient for a jury to find that she was about to report.\nMallett, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Kelly, J.\nIn her deposition, Shallal was asked if her testimony was that she had been \u201cabout to\u201d report to a public body for a period of time, two or three years. She responded:\nI think when this \u2014 these things came up, you know, those wrongdoings, and when they came up, and the feeling of reporting was thought about, it was \u2014 again, it was like trying to confirm the information, trying to find who would be the best to report it to, who would intervene in the most, you know, best way. And I think it took a while to be able to decide exactly when to do it. I wanted to do it but when it [was], you know \u2014 again, it was all part of a process that I felt . . .\nThe deposer then repeated the question and Shallal responded \u201cyes.\u201d This falls short of evidence that Shallal definitely had formed the intent to report the violations to a public body with some immediacy.\nNew York\u2019s equivalent to Michigan\u2019s Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act provides that an employer cannot take retaliatory action against an employee if the employee\ndiscloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy or practice of the employer that is in violation of law ....

    "head_matter": "SHALLAL v CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES OF WAYNE COUNTY\nDocket No. 103125.\nArgued April 9, 1997\n(Calendar No. 15).\nDecided July 30, 1997.\nJanette Shallal brought an action in the Wayne Circuit Court against Catholic Social Services of Wayne County and its president, Thomas D. Quinn, alleging retaliatory discharge in violation of the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, MCL 15.361 et seq.; MSA 17.428(1) et seq. The court, John H. Hausner, J., granted summary disposition for the defendants, finding no evidence that the plaintiff was about to report a violation of law at the time of her firing. The Court of Appeals, Jansen, P.J., and M. J. Talbot, J. (White, X, concurring in part and dissenting in part), affirmed in an unpublished opinion per curiam, concluding, as a matter of law, that no reasonable person could have believed that the plaintiff was about to report a violation for purposes of the act (Docket No. 155006). The plaintiff appeals.\nIn an opinion by Justice Cavanagh, joined by Justices Boyle, Riley, and Weaver, the Supreme Court held:\nThe plaintiff presented sufficient facts upon which reasonable minds could conclude that she was about to report a suspected violation. However, because she used the threat of reporting the defendant to force him to allow her to keep her job, no reasonable juror could conclude there was a causal connection between her firing and the protected activity.\n1. MCL 15.361 et seq.; MSA 17.428(1) et seq. does not require a plaintiff to actually report a suspected violation. An employee \u201cabout to report\u201d receives the same level of protection as one who has actually reported to a public body The plaintiff\u2019s conditional threat to her employer was credible evidence that she had finally decided that she was going to report him. Giving her employer the opportunity to correct his behavior does not in any way affect whether she had formed the requisite intent to report her supervisor. A plaintiff should not be required to say \u201cmagic words\u201d in order to reap the protections of the statute. It should be sufficient that the plaintiff actually threatened to report an employer. The plaintiff has met her burden of demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether she possessed an actual intent to report defendant\u2019s violations.\n2. However, the plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between her actions and her firing. The primary motivation of an employee pursuing a whistleblower claim must be a desire to inform the public on matters of public concern, and not personal vindictiveness. It is clear that the plaintiff used her own situation to extort defendant not to fire her. No reasonable juror could conclude that the plaintiff threatened to report her supervisor out of an altruistic motive of protecting the public. Furthermore, it is clear that the decision to fire plaintiff was made before her threat to her supervisor.\nAffirmed.\nJustice Kelly, joined by Chief Justice Mallett and Justice Brickley, concurring in part and dissenting in part, stated that the plaintiff failed to present evidence that she had formed a definite intent to report to a public body in the near future. Without that intent, she could hardly be found to have been about to report, unless she was about to report without knowing it. No reasonable jury could conclude from the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s discussions about reporting Quinn and her threats to him that she actually formed the intent to do so in the near future. Summary disposition was properly granted.\nChambers, Steiner (by Michelle J. Harrison and Courtney E. Morgan, Jr.), and Angela Nicita for plaintiff-appellant.\nBodman, Longley & Dahling, L.L.P.
