        "text": "BY THE COURT:\nIT IS ORDERED that the petition for writ of mandamus be GRANTED. The district court is instructed to: (1) vacate its order which permits unlimited discovery by Burlington Northern and directs the government to comply with the railroad\u2019s discovery requests; (2) promptly address and decide the action for enforcement of the Inspector General\u2019s administrative subpoena to Burlington Northern; and (3) pending resolution of the enforcement action, defer and suspend all activity, specifically including discovery, in the consolidated suit by Burlington Northern for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages.\nJudicial review of an administrative subpoena in an enforcement action is limited and is to be handled summarily and with dispatch. In re EEOC, 709 F.2d 392 (5th Cir.1983); see also EEOC v. K-Mart, 694 F.2d 1055 (6th Cir.1982). The trial court consolidated the government\u2019s enforcement action with Burlington Northern\u2019s suit for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. Prior to the final resolution of the government\u2019s action for enforcement of the administrative subpoena, the railroad may not maintain an action which seeks, inter alia, an injunction of that subpoena. Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 449-50, 84 S.Ct. 508, 513-14, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964); Atlantic Richfield Co. v. FTC, 546 F.2d 646 (5th Cir.1977). Accordingly, the district court must defer all further action in the railroad\u2019s suit pending the final resolution of the action to enforce the administrative subpoena. Because Burlington Northern has an adequate remedy in the defense of the subpoena enforcement action, the separate and independent action to enjoin the administrative subpoena is foreclosed. Reisman v. Caplin. The railroad cited to the district court Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., 436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), and Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), in support of its discrete litigation. Those cases are inapposite for the railroad has made no showing of comparable prejudice which would justify pre-enforcement judicial intervention.\nAs noted, subpoena enforcement actions are intended to be summary and are designed to secure quick judicial review of administrative activities. Consistent therewith, discovery is allowed in only the exceptional eases \u201cwhere the circumstances indicate that further information is necessary for the courts to discharge their duty.\u201d SEC v. Dresser Indus., 628 F.2d 1368, 1388 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 529, 66 L.Ed.2d 289 (1980). The separate but consolidated action by Burlington Northern may not serve as the basis for broader discovery than that which is permitted in subpoena enforcement actions.\nAs a general rule, \u201ca defendant is not \u2018entitled to engage in counter-discovery to find grounds for resisting\u2019 a subpoena...'.\u201d In re EEOC, 709 F.2d at 400 (citations omitted). A limited amount of discovery may be allowed if, for example, \u201cthe defendant \u2018makes a preliminary and substantial demonstration of abuse,\u2019 that is, where the defendant has presented \u2018meaningful evidence\u2019 that the agency is attempting to abuse its investigative authority. Anything short of this showing is not enough_\u201d Id. (citations omitted). In considering the issue of the scope and range of discovery in enforcement actions, courts \u201c \u2018must be cautious in granting ... discovery rights, lest they transform subpoena enforcement proceedings into exhaustive inquisitions into the practices of the regulatory agencies.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Aero Mayflower Transit Co., 831 F.2d 1142, 1147 (D.C.Cir.1987) (quoting Dresser, 628 F.2d at 1388).\nIn the case at bar Burlington Northern asserts that the administrative subpoena should not be enforced because the Inspector General lacks the statutory authority to conduct the planned audit of the railroad. Such a defense to the enforcement action requires that the court interpret the relevant statutes; little if any discovery should be required in that endeavor.\nUpon its further consideration, should the district court determine that Burlington Northern is to be permitted a limited, measured amount of discovery in the enforcement action, it shall remain mindful of the requirement that exceptional circumstances must exist before the involuntary depositions of high agency officials are permitted. EEOC v. K-Mart, 694 F.2d at 1067-68. We agree with our D.C. Circuit colleagues that \u201ctop executive department officials should not, absent extraordinary circumstances, be called to testify regarding their reasons for taking official actions.\u201d Simplex Time Recorder Co. v. Secretary of Labor, 766 F.2d 575, 586 (D.C.Cir.1985) (citing United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 1004-05, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941)); cf. Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F.2d 542 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S.Ct. 174, 74 L.Ed.2d 143 (1982); Kyle Eng\u2019g Co. v. Kleppe, 600 F.2d 226 (9th Cir.1979); United States Bd. of Parole v. Merhige, 487 F.2d 25 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 918, 94 S.Ct. 2625, 41 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). Further, we have concluded that it is normally inappropriate to \u201cprobe the mental processes and motives of the individual decision-maker, rather than to question the objective legal validity of the institutional decision.\u201d Kent Corp. v. NLRB, 530 F.2d 612, 620 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 316, 50 L.Ed.2d 287 (1976).\nThis matter is returned to the district court for further proceedings consistent herewith. The mandate shall issue forthwith.",
