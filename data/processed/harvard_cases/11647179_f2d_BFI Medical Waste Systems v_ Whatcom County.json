      {
        "text": "ORDER\nThe memorandum disposition filed October 21, 1992, is redesignated as an authored opinion by Judge Farris.\nOPINION\nFARRIS, Circuit Judge:\nThe Whatcom County council adopted the Medical Waste Ban Ordinance on August 10, 1989. Ordinance 89-61 (Aug. 10, 1989). Section 2 provides that:\n[Effective January 1, 1990, infectious medical waste generated outside the territorial limits of Whatcom County shall not be accepted for disposal at a waste disposal facility within Whatcom County.\nThree waste management companies \u2014 BFI Medical Waste Systems, Inc., BFI Medical Waste Systems of California, Inc., and Browning-Ferris Industries, Ltd. \u2014 dispose of medical waste at a privately owned incinerator in Ferndale, which is located in Whatcom County. Medical waste is shipped to the Ferndale incinerator from all parts of Washington, Vancouver, British Columbia, and Portland, Oregon. In December 1989, the three companies filed suit to enjoin the enforcement of Ordinance 89-61.\nOn January 23, 1991, Magistrate Judge Weinberg granted summary judgment finding that Ordinance 89-61 violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, 756 F.Supp. 480. On July 15, 1991, Magistrate Judge Weinberg denied BFI\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Whatcom County appeals the grant of summary judgment, and BFI appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its request for attorney\u2019s fees.\nI. Commerce Clause\nThe \u201cnegative\u201d or \u201cdormant\u201d Commerce Clause prohibits interstate curtailment of commerce to advance a particular state\u2019s interest. Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res., \u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 2019, 2023, 119 L.Ed.2d 139 (1992). Ordinance 89-61 implicates the Commerce Clause because waste is an article of commerce. Id. \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2023; Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 622-23, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 2534-35, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978).\nThe Supreme Court has recently held that laws that discriminate against out-of-state business interests are per se unconstitutional even if it is a county rather than the state itself that discriminates:\n... [0]ur prior cases teach that a State (or one of its political subdivisions) may not avoid the strictures of the Commerce Clause by curtailing the movement of articles of commerce through subdivisions of the State, rather than through the State itself.\nFort Gratiot, \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2024. Under Fort Gratiot, out-of-county waste bans are per se unconstitutional.\nWhatcom County must therefore demonstrate that its discrimination is \u201cjustified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.\u201d New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 274, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 1808, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988). Whatcom County contends that Ordinance 89-61 protects its residents from the hazards of transporting and disposing of medical waste but fails to establish that medical waste from outside the county is more dangerous than medical waste generated inside Whatcom County. That defect is fatal. Chemical Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. Hunt, \u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 2009, 2015, 119 L.Ed.2d 121 (1992); see also Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. at 626-27, 98 S.Ct. at 2536-37.\nWhatcom County argues that the out-of-county medical waste is more hazardous because it has travelled many miles. The Supreme Court rejected this assertion in Chemical Waste, \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 112 S.Ct. at 2014. Ordinance 89-61 violates the Commerce Clause. Fort Gratiot, \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2027; see also Washington State Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v. Spellman, 684 F.2d 627, 631 (9th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 913, 103 S.Ct. 1891, 77 L.Ed.2d 282 (1983).\nWhatcom County\u2019s claim that the quarantine exception applies is without merit. Chemical Waste held that quarantine laws \u201c \u2018did not discriminate against interstate commerce as such, but simply prevented traffic in noxious articles, whatever their origin\u2019 \u201d. Chemical Waste, \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2016 (quoting Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. at 629, 98 S.Ct. at 2538). Whatcom County produces local medical waste. Ordinance 89-61 does not quarantine all medical waste. See Chemical Waste, \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2017; Fort Gratiot, \u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 2028. Instead it establishes a preference for local waste. Summary judgment was proper.\nII. Attorney\u2019s Fees\nBFI Medical Waste appeals the Magistrate Judge\u2019s denial of its request for attorney\u2019s fees. In Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 111 S.Ct. 865, 112 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991), the Supreme Court held that Commerce Clause violations are cognizable under 42 U.S.G. \u00a7 1983 (1988). Litigants who successfully bring suit under the Commerce Clause may recover damages under \u00a7 1983 and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. The district court decided that Dennis should not apply retroactively to BFI\u2019s claim. See Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 107, 92 S.Ct. 349, 355-56, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971). It held that BFI could not recover attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe rule regarding retroactivity is set forth in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, \u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991). In Beam, the Court held that once a court \u201chas applied a rule of law to the litigants in one case it must\u201d apply the rule to all litigants whose cases were pending on direct review. Beam, \u2014 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 2448; see also Melton v. Moore, 964 F.2d 880, 881-82 (9th Cir.1992). Dennis did apply the new rule retroactively. See Dennis, 498 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 873. We must therefore do the same.\nAlthough Dennis does apply retroactively, the district court may have correctly denied BFI\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 gives the district court the discretion to grant or deny attorney\u2019s fees to successful \u00a7 1983 litigants. However, \u201ca court\u2019s discretion to deny fees under \u00a7 1988 is very narrow\u201d and \u201c \u2018fee awards should be the rule rather than the exception.\u2019 \u201d Herrington v. County of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739, 743 (9th Cir.1989) (quoting Teitelbaum v. Sorenson, 648 F.2d 1248, 1251 (9th Cir.1981)).\nThe district court must consider \u201cfactors related to the Act\u2019s purpose\u201d to determine whether to award attorney\u2019s fees. Such factors include 1) the parties\u2019 reliance on the unavailability of a fee award; 2) the presence of bad faith by either party; 3) the size of the class benefitted by the litigation; and 4) the need for an attorney's fee in order to attract competent counsel to the suit. Aho v. Clark, 608 F.2d 365, 367 (9th Cir.1979).\nThe district court did ' not determine whether attorney\u2019s fees would be available to BFI under \u00a7 1988, because it decided that \u00a7 1988 would not apply to BFI's claim at all. We therefore remand to the district court to determine whether attorney\u2019s fees are appropriate under \u00a7 1988 utilizing the factors enumerated above.\nWe deny BFI\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees for this appeal. We affirm the injunction of Ordinance 89-61. We remand for the court to exercise its discretion whether to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. Each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.\nAffirmed in part. Remanded.",
