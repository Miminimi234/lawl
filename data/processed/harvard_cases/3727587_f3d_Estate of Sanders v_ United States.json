        "text": "HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge.\nIra J. Sanders (\u201cSanders\u201d), who received medical treatment from the Department of Veterans Affairs, died of stomach cancer in 2008. Sanders\u2019s estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d) filed a malpractice suit against his health care providers under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), alleging in part that they failed to provide appropriate follow-up care after discovering a mass in Sanders\u2019s stomach in 2003. The district court granted summary judgment for the United States based on its finding that the Estate\u2019s expert report failed to establish the relevant standard of care or create a question of fact as to the remaining elements of a malpractice claim under Mississippi law. Despite the tragic facts of this case, we agree that the expert\u2019s report was legally inadequate, and we AFFIRM.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nSanders experienced symptoms of reflux in 2003 and sought attention from his primary care doctors at the Meridian Community Based Outpatient Clinic (\u201cMeridian Clinic\u201d). Doctors at the Meridian Clinic referred Sanders to the Jackson VA Medical Center (\u201cJVAMC\u201d) for an esophago-gastroduodenoscopy (alternately referred to in the record as an \u201cendoscopy\u201d or \u201cEGD\u201d), a procedure that visualizes the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Dr. Maher Azzouz, a board-certified gas-troenterologist, performed the EGD on December 10, 2003. According to JVAMC medical records, Dr. Azzouz discovered a \u201cmass\u201d in Sanders\u2019s stomach, which the medical records describe as: \u201cfragments of adenomatous dysplatic mucosa, consistent with papillary adenoma.\u201d\nThe medical records also note findings of \u201c[cjomplete intestinal metaplasia.\u201d The medical records for December 12, 2003, indicate that due to the \u201cstomach polyp,\u201d Dr. Azzouz was \u201cto do Endoscreen\u201d on February 12, 2004, and that Sanders would be \u201cnotified by letter.\u201d On January 26, 2004, Dr. Azzouz rescheduled the follow-up test for March 12, 2004. Under \u201cindications for procedure,\u201d the records again note: \u201cstomach[] polyp.\u201d Sanders was notified of the date of the procedure, but the Estate alleges that he was not notified of the reason it was needed.\nTwo of Sanders\u2019s children, Belinda and James, accompanied Sanders to the JVAMC on March 12, 2004. According to Belinda and James Sanders\u2019s affidavits, upon arrival, they were \u201ctold by staff members ... that there was no EGD scheduled for [Sanders] that day and that since he had an EGD performed with[in] the past year that there was no necessity to repeat the test.\u201d\nIn the summer of 2008, Sanders was again evaluated at the Meridian Clinic after experiencing weight loss and difficulty eating. He was admitted to JVAMC on July 8, 2008; an EGD performed by Dr. Stephen Tuuri the next day revealed a cancerous stomach mass. Sanders underwent surgery on July 25, 2008. He died on July 29, 2008. The Estate does not allege malpractice in connection with Sanders\u2019s care in 2008.\nRuther Sanders, Sanders\u2019s widow and the administrator of the Estate, filed an FTCA claim in June 2010. The complaint alleged malpractice on the part of the United States \u201cacting through its agents, servants and or employees at the [JVAMC] in Jackson, Mississippi and also at the [Meridian Clinic].\u201d The Estate asserted that employees both of the JVAMC and the Meridian Clinic \u201cowed a duty to [Sanders] to relay to him the results of the endoscopy performed by Dr. Azzouz on 12-10-2003 ... and further to provide appropriate follow-up care for the pre-cancerous stomach lesion which if performed pursuant to the standard of care, the cancer would have been detected at an earlier date and would have been amenable to surgical cure.\u201d The complaint continued: \u201cAs a direct and proximate result of the failure to provide the appropriate standard of care ... Sanders\u2019[s] disease remained untreated and he subsequently died.\u201d\nThe district court, on the agreement of both parties, granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the Meridian Clinic defendants, on the grounds that they were not government employees under the FTCA. The order noted that the Estate\u2019s \u201cclaims regarding Dr. Azzouz, an employee of the government, are not the subject of the motion to dismiss,\u201d but did not mention potential claims against other JVAMC employees.\nBoth parties submitted expert reports. The Estate\u2019s report was authored by Dr. Robert Sklaroff, an attending physician at Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, who is board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology. Dr. Skarloffs report concluded that, had Sanders\nbeen provided episodic follow-up gastro-scopio evaluations, the lesion would have been detected at an earlier moment in its natural history ... [ellipsis in report] when it would have been amenable to surgical cure. It was beneath the standard-of-care for such monitoring not to have been offered to the patient during the half-decade between the detection of the pathologic abnormalities and the establishment of the diagnosis of inoperable disease.\nThe government submitted a report authored by Dr. Thomas L. Abell, chief of gastroenterology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Dr. Abell concluded:\nThe procedure and recommendations by Dr. Maher Azzouz, the Gastroenterologist performing the procedure, were appropriate and meet the standard of care for this case. Further monitoring of this patient and follow up care were the responsibility of the patient\u2019s primary care physician and not the responsibility of Dr. Azzouz, who met the standard of care in all aspects in this case.\nThe government moved for summary judgment, arguing that Dr. Skarloffs report failed to establish the necessary elements of a medical malpractice claim against Dr. Azzouz. In its response, the Estate emphasized that its \u201clone remaining claim is against employees of the [JVAMC], including but NOT solely limited to, Dr. Maher Azzouz.\u201d The Estate maintained: \u201cIt is Dr. Sklaroffs opinion ... that the standard of care was breached by employees of the [JVAMC] including Dr. Azzouz, by failing to set up the EGD procedure on 3-12-2004 as ordered by Dr. Azzouz.\u201d\nThe district court granted summary judgment for the government, finding that Dr. Sklaroffs report was inadequate. It agreed with the government that five deficiencies marred Dr. Sklaroff s report: failure to mention a government employee by name as having breached the standard of care; failure to articulate the applicable standard of care; failure to state Dr. Skla-roff s familiarity with the applicable standard of care; failure to indicate that a JVAMC employee rather than one of Sanders\u2019 primary care providers had the duty to provide follow-up care; and failure to show causation.\nAdditionally, the district court found no support in the expert report nor the medical records for the Estate\u2019s theory that the mass detected in 2003 was the same mass found to be cancerous in 2008, and that JVAMC employees other than Dr. Azzouz were negligent in not ensuring the second EGD took place. The district court interpreted Dr. Sklaroffs comment that had someone placed Sanders on a monitoring program, \u201cthe lesion would have been'detected at an earlier moment\u201d to imply that the 2003 and 2008 masses were unrelated. The district court found that the medical records neither described the 2003 mass as pre-cancerous nor linked it to the 2008 mass. Even assuming a link between the 2003 and 2008 masses, the district court found that \u201cnothing suggests that Sanders\u2019s cancer would have been discernable by March 2004,\u201d when the follow-up EGD was scheduled to have been performed.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThis court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. Moss v. BMC Software, Inc., 610 F.3d 917, 922 (5th Cir.2010). It may award summary judgment if, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See United Fire & Cas. Co. v. Hixson Bros., Inc., 453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir.2006); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A dispute gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact when the evidence permits a reasonable jury to return \u201ca verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cSummary judgment must be affirmed if it is sustainable on any legal ground in the record, and it may be affirmed on grounds rejected or not stated by the district court.\u201d S & W Enterprises, L.L.C. v. SouthTrust Bank of Alabama, NA, 315 F.3d 533, 537-38 (5th Cir.2003) (citations omitted).\nDISCUSSION\nThe FTCA allows suits against the United States for personal injury or death caused by a government employee\u2019s negligence \u201cunder circumstances in which a private person would be liable under the law of the state in which the negligent act or omission occurred.\u201d Hannah v. United States, 523 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2008); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b)(1), 2674. Liability in FTCA medical malpractice cases is controlled by state law. Hannah, 523 F.3d at 601; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). Thus, we look to Mississippi law to determine the elements of the malpractice claim.\nUnder Mississippi law, a prima facie case of medical malpractice requires proof of the following elements: \u201c(1) the existence of a duty by the defendant to conform to a specific standard of conduct for the protection \u00f3f others against an unreasonable risk of injury; (2) a failure to conform to the required standard; and (3) an injury to the plaintiff proximately caused by the breach of such duty by the defendant.\u201d Hubbard v. Wansley, 954 So.2d 951, 956-57 (Miss.2007). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these elements at the summary judgment stage through supporting evidence. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\nExpert testimony must be used to establish these elements in a medical malpractice claim. Hubbard, 954 So.2d at 957 (citing Barner v. Gorman, 605 So.2d 805, 809 (Miss.1992)). \u201cNot only must this expert identify and articulate the requisite standard that was not complied with, the expert must also establish that the failure was the proximate cause, or proximate contributing cause, of the alleged injuries.\u201d Id. (quoting Barner, 605 So.2d at 809); see also McDonald v. Mem\u2019l Hosp. at Gulfport, 8 So.3d 175, 180 (Miss.2009); Cheeks v. Bio-Med. Applications, Inc., 908 So.2d 117, 120 (Miss.2005). If the plaintiff fails to present sufficient evidence as to these elements, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and therefore summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548. \u201cThe success of a plaintiff in establishing a case of medical malpractice rests heavily on the shoulders of the plaintiffs selected medical expert.\u201d Estate of Northrop v. Hutto, 9 So.3d 381, 384 (Miss.2009).\nThe relevant section of Dr. Sklaroffs report reads as follows:\nThis 80-year-old male ... presented on 12/10/2003 for endoscopy due to symptoms of Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease [\u201cGERD\u201d]. The Procedure Report is not complete, but the Pathology Report revealed that a \u201cStomach Mass\u201d demonstrated gastritis, and dysplasia. No follow-up was provided to assess these findings.\nThe Problem List was otherwise not contributory....\nOn 7/25/2008, [Sanders] underwent a gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer (with posterior fixation and hepatic involvement), at which time he had a feeding jejunostomy. By information and belief, it is noted that he died on 7/29/2008.\nTherefore, had [Sanders] been provided episodic follow-up gastroscopic evaluations, the lesion would have been detected at an earlier moment in its natural history ... [ellipsis in report] when it would have been amenable to surgical cure. It was beneath the standard-of-care for such monitoring not to have been offered to the patient during the half-decade between the detection of the pathologic abnormalities and the establishment of the diagnosis of inoperable disease.\nThe district court found, inter alia, that Dr. Sklaroffs report was deficient, failing to establish a question of fact as to causation. Under Mississippi law, \u201c[i]n a medical malpractice case, as in all claims for negligence, causation must be proven in order to establish a prima facie case.\u201d Hubbard, 954 So.2d at 964. \u201cMississippi law does not permit recovery of damages because of mere diminishment of the chance of recovery. Recovery is allowed only when the failure of the physician to render the required level of care results in the loss of a reasonable probability of substantial improvement of the plaintiffs condition.\u201d Id. In other words, the plaintiff must present evidence that proper treatment would lead to \u201ca greater than fifty (50) percent chance of a better result than was in fact obtained.\u201d Id. (quoting Ladner v. Campbell, 515 So.2d at 889 (Miss.1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a \u201cmere better result absent malpractice\u201d would not meet the causation requirement. Id. (quoting Ladner, 515 So.2d at 889).\nFurther, the \u201cexpert opinion of a doctor as to causation must be expressed in terms of medical probabilities as opposed to possibilities.\u201d Univ. Of Mississippi Med. Ctr. v. Lanier, 97 So.3d 1197, 1202 (Miss.2012), reh\u2019g denied (Oct. 4, 2012). \u201c[T]he intent of the law is that if a physician cannot form an opinion with sufficient certainty so as to make a medical judgment, neither can a jury use that information to reach a decision.\u201d Id. (quoting Catchings v. State, 684 So.2d 591, 597 (Miss.1996)). This does not, however, mean that experts must use \u201cmagic words\u201d like the phrase \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d Vanlandingham v. Patton, 35 So.3d 1242, 1249 (Miss. Ct.App.2010). If the \u201cimport of [the expert\u2019s] testimony [is] apparent,\u201d id., that is enough:\nThe Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized \u201cthat the plaintiff is rarely able to prove to an absolute certainty what would have happened if early treatment, referral or surgery had happened.\u201d Clayton v. Thompson, 475 So.2d 439, 445 (Miss.1985). Thus, causation may be established through circumstantial evidence so long as the circumstances shown \u201ctake the case out of the realm of conjecture and place it within the field of legitimate inference.\u201d Estate of Gibson ex rel. Gibson v. Magnolia Healthcare, Inc., 91 So.3d 616, 625 (Miss.2012).\nLadner ex rel. Ladner v. Forrest Gen. Hosp., 2:12CV19-KS-MTP, 2013 WL 3776695, at *5 (S.D.Miss. July 18, 2013).\nMississippi courts have recognized that in cases such as this one, where the injury resulted from an underlying disease and the alleged malpractice took the form of a failure to cure, rather than the results of \u201cany positive effects of mistreatment,\u201d establishing causation is \u201cparticularly difficult.\u201d Ladner, 515 So.2d at 888. Nonetheless, the plaintiff must still establish \u201cwith evidence that it was probable, or more likely than not, that the patient would have been helped by proper treatment.\u201d Id.\nIn Hubbard v. Wansley, the Mississippi Supreme Court considered a case in which a patient fell unconscious at a hospital and struck her head during the fall. 954 So.2d at 954. Her doctor, Dr. Wansley, was contacted by telephone and advised the nurse to monitor the patient\u2019s blood pressure and consciousness for two hours and to send her home if there was no change. Id. at 954-55. The patient was sent home, but she was later diagnosed with a hemorrhage. Id. at 955. The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Dr. Wansley, in part because the plaintiffs expert, Dr. Stringer, failed to establish causation. Id. at 966.\nDr. Stringer authored two affidavits. Id. at 964. In the first, he stated: \u201cIn my opinion, [the patient] was deprived the opportunity of full recovery after her fall because of lack of treatment.\u201d Id. In deposition testimony, Dr. Stringer admitted that even had the patient received \u201coptimum medical care,\u201d she could still have ended up in the same poor condition. Id. at 965. In his second affidavit, Dr. Stringer asserted that the patient would have had a greater than fifty percent chance of reduced injury with \u201cproper[ ]\u201d treatment, but that assertion was \u201cgiven with no real facts to back it up\u201d; instead, it was \u201calmost wholly eonclusory on the issue of causation and [gave] very little in the way of specific facts and medical analysis to substantiate the claim.\u201d Id. at 965-66; see also Perez v. Univ. of Mississippi Med. Ctr., 75 So.3d 609, 612 (Miss.2011) (expert\u2019s affidavit was \u201ceonclusory\u201d where he \u201cfailed to explain how or why using Floxin Otic instead of Ocuflux could have caused Perez\u2019s eye injury.\u201d).\nIn this case, Dr. Sklaroffs report concluded: \u201c[H]ad [Sanders] been provided episodic follow-up gastroscopic evaluations, the lesion would have been detected at an earlier moment in its natural history ... when it would have been amenable to surgical cure.\u201d The district court noted that it is unclear whether by stating that \u201cthe lesion would have been detected\u201d (emphasis added), Dr. Sklaroff was suggesting that the 2003 mass did not itself become cancerous. But even assuming, as the Estate urges, that the mass detected in 2003 later became cancerous, Dr. Sklaroffs assertion that the lesion \u201cwould have been amenable to surgical cure\u201d does not establish the probability of a better outcome nor take that probability out of the realm of conjecture. See Estate of Gibson, 91 So.3d at 625 (holding that \u201ctestimony, taken as a whole, must establish \u2018reasonable medical certainty\u2019 that the negligence caused the injuries at issue\u201d) (citation omitted); Hubbard, 954 So.2d at 964; Lanier, 97 So.3d at 1202 n. 3 (\u201c[W]e take this opportunity to state with clarity that expert medical testimony as to causation must be set forth in terms of medical probability.\u201d).\nDr. Sklaroffs report is distinguishable from testimony in another failure-to-diagnose case, Ladner v. Campbell, which the Mississippi Supreme Court found did create a triable issue of fact. 515 So.2d at 887. In Ladner, the defendant physician failed to diagnose a lump in the patient\u2019s breast as cancerous. Id. at 884.. The plaintiff introduced an expert report stating that \u201cwithin a reasonable medical probability, a mammography on that day [that the defendant first examined the lump] would have detected the lesion; and that the failure to diagnose probably caused her long term survival to be significantly decreased.\u201d Id. at 887. Although the report acknowledged that \u201cprognostication about a cancer patient\u2019s chances is difficult,\u201d it went through specific factors that would give the patient a \u201cfive year survival chance of 62 percent on [the day the lesion should have been discovered], as opposed to 32 percent at the time of her surgery.\u201d Id. at 887 (noting, inter alia, the small size of the tumor and the number of lymph nodes affected). By contrast, Dr. Skla-roffs affidavit included no specific analysis of the results of Sanders\u2019s EGD, nor the point at which surgical intervention would have yielded a better outcome. We therefore conclude that the Estate failed to establish a triable issue of fact on the question of causation.\nIn addition, we conclude that Dr. Sklaroff failed to establish with any specificity the standard of care applicable to Dr. Azzouz, or the particulars of Dr. Azzouz\u2019s, or any other hospital employee\u2019s, alleged breach of duty. Expert testimony under Mississippi law must \u201c(a) articulate[ ] the duty of care the physician owes to a particular patient under the circumstances, and (b) identify! ] the particular(s) wherein the physician breached that duty and caused injury to the plaintiff patient.\u201d Phillips ex rel. Phillips v. Hull, 516 So.2d 488, 491 (Miss.1987) (en banc) (overruled on other grounds by Whittington v. Mason, 905 So.2d 1261 (Miss.2005)). Dr. Sklaroff asserted that Sanders should have been \u201cprovided episodic follow-up gastroscopic evaluations,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was beneath the standard-of-care for such monitoring not to have been offered to the patient during the half-decade\u201d following the first EGD. Dr. Sklaroff did not clarify how often \u201cepisodic\u201d evaluations should have taken place. See Hans v. Mem\u2019l Hospital at Gulfport, 40 So.3d 1270, 1280 (Miss.Ct.App.2010) (holding that an expert\u2019s report failed to establish the standard of care when it did not clarify \u201c[h]ow soon is \u2018soon,\u2019 \u201d \u201c[w]hat would be considered \u2018an appropriate disposition,\u2019 \u201d and \u201chow any other procedure would have reduced delay\u201d). In addition, although Dr. Sklaroff asserts that \u201cno follow-up was offered\u201d (emphasis added), he did not mention that Sanders was scheduled for a repeat EGD. This omission is significant because Dr. Sklaroff does not identify a particular alleged breach of duty \u2014 for example, not notifying Sanders of the EGD results; turning him away at his follow-up appointment; or not scheduling future follow-up appointments \u2014 nor does he specify the individual hospital staff member at fault for the alleged breach. See Hans, 40 So.3d at 1279; Powell v. Methodist Health Care Jackson Hosps., 856 So.2d 353, 356 (Miss.Ct.App.2003); cf. Estate of Guillotte ex rel. Jordan v. Delta Health Grp., Inc., 5 So.3d 393, 408-09 (Miss.2009) (reversing a grant of summary judgment to defendants where, although the plaintiffs experts did not identify individual defendants by name, there was \u201ca significant amount of expert testimony ... regarding individual staff members\u2019 negligence,\u201d and \u201cthe depositions as a whole clearly indicate that individual staff members breached the standard of care\u201d).\nCONCLUSION\nBecause Dr. Sklaroffs report does not establish causation as a medical probability or point to a breach of the standard of care with the requisite specificity, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the government.\n. On February 2, 2009, a Standard Form 95 \"Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death\u201d was submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs; it was denied on December 31, 2009.\n. According to the government\u2019s brief, plaintiff also filed a second lawsuit against Staff Care, Inc., the company employing physicians at the Meridian Clinic. That lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a stipulation.\n.If depositions of either expert were conducted, they neither appear in the record nor were adverted to by the parties.\n. The exception to this rule is for \u201csituations of obvious negligence,\u201d which \"a layman can understand without expert testimony\u201d as \"a matter of common sense and practical expertence.\u201d Hubbard, 954 So.2d at 960-61 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Estate does not argue that the layman's exception applies in this case.\n. Because we find that Dr. Sklaroff's report did not create a fact issue as to causation, nor as to standard of care and breach of duty, we do not reach the question of whether Dr. Sklaroff was qualified to give an expert opinion as to the standard of care applicable to a gastroenterologist such as Dr. Azzouz.",
