We hold, contrary to this award, that Louisiana\u2019s penalty provision is inconsistent with and therefore preempted by the federal law regulating federal employee health benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8902(m)(l). We also hold that although Mahaffey did not file a standard claim form with GEHA, she informed the carrier timely and repeatedly of her quest for benefits, both orally and in writing, in substantial compliance with GEHA\u2019s contractual provisions concerning the filing of claims. Consequently, the judgment for recovery of medical expenses, though not for statutory penalties and attorneys fees, is affirmed.\nBACKGROUND\nThe facts are recited as found by the district court. On December 17,1981 plaintiff, Linda Burkey, an employee of the Naval Station in New Orleans, had family coverage for herself and her son, Carey, under a group health policy issued by GEHA as an authorized carrier under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (\u201cFEHBA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8901 et seq. Carey became 22 on November 19, 1981. On December 17, 1981 Carey was rendered a quadriplegic when he was a passenger in an automobile involved in a collision. Carey was immediately hospitalized at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, just three days before the 31st day after his 22nd birthday. Charity Hospital treated him continuously during his inpatient hospitalization from December 18, 1981 to June 1983.\nRegulations of the federal Office of Personnel Management, which superintends FEHBA, 5 C.F.R. Part 890, and the GEHA policy provide that Carey was covered until age 22 and that he was entitled to a 31-day extension thereafter. In addition, if he were hospitalized on the 31st day of that extension, he was entitled to 60 days coverage for continuous hospitalization. 5 CFR 890.401. February 18, 1982 was the 63rd day of Carey\u2019s continuous hospitalization after his injuries; from December 17 until February 18, Carey\u2019s medical expenses at Charity were $44,693.00.\nImmediately upon learning of her son\u2019s serious condition, Mrs. Burkey contacted her employer seeking confirmation that Carey was covered by GEHA so he could be transferred to a private hospital specializing in treatment of spinal cord injuries. Despite her own contact with GEHA verbally and through her employer and her repeated written pleas for help, Burkey never received that confirmation. Her son continued on public assistance at Charity. On June 1, 1982, Linda Burkey prepared for her lawyer to submit to GEHA its claim form E-l seeking confirmation that Carey\u2019s medical needs as a result of his 1981 injury were covered. The E-l was received by GEHA before June 25, 1982. In response to her E-l, plaintiff received a GEHA form F-012 stating only, \u201cchildren are covered until age 22,\u201d without further explanation. When, in late 1982, Mrs. Burkey received a copy of GEHA\u2019s \u201copen season\u201d announcement that referenced the 31-day extension following a person\u2019s 22nd birthday, she wrote to GEHA\u2019s claim office and inquired whether Carey was entitled to the 31-day extension of coverage. Her letter advised GEHA of all pertinent facts needed to determine whether or not Carey was entitled to medical services: (a) Carey severed his spinal cord in a December 1981 accident; (b) GEHA refused coverage and Carey had been in Charity Hospital continuously since that time; (c) she had sent an E-l to GEHA in June 1982; (d) she had received form F-012 from GEHA apparently denying Carey\u2019s entitlement to coverage because he was over age 22. GEHA did not respond to plaintiff\u2019s letter.\nOn December 23, 1982, Mrs. Burkey again wrote to GEHA\u2019s claim office addressing her letter to its President, Mr. Rowland. She enclosed copies of her E-l and GEHA\u2019s F-012 denying coverage. On December 23, Mrs. Burkey also wrote to Congresswoman Lindy Boggs and outlined the difficulties with GEHA. Because Carey\u2019s insurance benefits were never confirmed by GEHA, Carey was never transferred to a private specialty hospital.\nGEHA\u2019s trial representative testified that if she had received the E-l and Mrs. Burkey\u2019s letters referred to above, she would have investigated the claim. She testified that it is not always a prerequisite to confirming coverage that a bill for medical services be received because in certain circumstances a bill may not be available to a plan participant until quite some time later. While admitting that Carey had hospitalization coverage from December \u201981 through February \u201982, she also agreed that once GEHA received Burkey\u2019s E-l, it had all the authority it needed to request bills directly from Charity.\nHaving found out about the Burkeys\u2019 lawsuit against GEHA, Louisiana\u2019s Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d) intervened to assert its interest in the claim for medical expenses incurred by Charity Hospital. The case was tried to the court without a jury on March 21,1991. At the conclusion of the trial, the court gave oral reasons for judgment in favor of plaintiffs under the Louisiana statutory penalty provision, and it remanded to a magistrate judge for an evidentiary hearing to determine reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the amount of medical bills. The magistrate judge recommended that $40,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees were reasonable and that $44,693 be recognized as the actual amount of medical expenses due. The court initially entered judgment in favor of the Bur-keys for twice the amount of medical expenses plus attorneys\u2019 fees of $40,000. After revising the judgment to recognize the intervenors\u2019 interest, the final damage award against GEHA remained $129,386, but $44,693 of that amount was ordered to be paid to DHHR and twenty-five percent of the $40,000 attorneys fees was ordered payable to the plaintiffs\u2019 former attorneys, who had also intervened.\nThe Burkeys and GEHA have appealed, but neither DHHR nor the attorney intervenors have done so. GEHA asserts that the district court incorrectly interpreted the scope of FEHBA preemption and therefore improperly applied Louisiana law in assessing coverage and awarding damages and attorneys fees. Further, GEHA claims that the substantive finding of coverage was incorrect under the GEHA plan. We agree with GEHA\u2019s preemption argument but disagree with its contention that plaintiffs\u2019 expenses were not covered by the plan because no complete claim form was filed. The Burkeys are thus entitled to recover only the stipulated expenses of $44,693 incurred at Charity Hospital, together with pre- and post-judgment interest, subject to the intervention judgment awarded DHHR by the district court.\nDISCUSSION\nWhile one federal circuit court has held otherwise concerning the scope of FEHBA preemption of state law, \u201cThe weight of authority and most persuasive analysis supports the position that state law claims are preempted\u201d. Federal Plaza Medical Associates v. Palermino, 1991 WL 29201 (S.D.N.Y.). Federal preemption of state law is fundamentally \u201ca question of Congressional intent ...\u201d English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 78, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 2275, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990) (citation omitted). Congress expressed itself with unusual clarity in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8902(m)(l), which states:\nThe provisions of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or regulation issued thereunder, to the extent that such law or regulation is inconsistent with such contractual provisions.\nThe policy underlying \u00a7 8902(m)(l) is to ensure nationwide uniformity of the administration of FEHBA benefits. Hayes v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, 819 F.2d 921, 925 (9th Cir.1987) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 282, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 4 (1977)), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1060, 108 S.Ct. 1014, 98 L.Ed.2d 980 (1988); Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida v. Department of Banking, 613 F.Supp. 188, 192-193 (D.C.Fla.1985) (discussion of legislative history of the preemption provision of FEHBA) aff'd 791 F.2d 1501 (11th Cir.1986), reh. denied, 797 F.2d 982 (11th Cir.1986); Hartenstine v. Superior Court, 196 Cal.App.3d 206, 220, 241 Cal.Rptr. 756, 765 (1987) (discussion OPM\u2019s belief that state law claims should be preempted because the imposition of varying state law requirements would undermine the purpose and objectives of the FEHBA), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 245, 102 L.Ed.2d 234 (1988).\nThe Burkeys argue that their state law claim for penalties is not preempted under \u00a7 8902(m)(l) because their claim relates to remedies and not to the \u201cnature or extent of coverage or benefits.\u201d No such distinction can sensibly be made. Tort claims arising out of the manner in which a benefit claim is handled are not separable from the terms of the contract that governs benefits. Compare Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 220, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 1915-16, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985). Moreover, such claims \u201crelate to\u201d the plan under \u00a7 8902(m)(l) as long as they have a connection with or refer to the plan, Blue Cross, 791 F.2d at 1504. The Supreme Court recently decided that similar language in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) broadly preempts state law tort and contract claims for benefits if they \u201crelate to\u201d ERISA-governed plans. Pilot Life Insurance Company v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 47, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1552, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987). See Gomez, Preemption and Preclusion of Employee Law Rights by Federal and State Statutes, 11 Indus.Rel.L.J. 45, 58 n. 90 (1989); Blue Shield of Florida, supra, 791 F.2d at 1504; Bar v. Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 297 Ark. 262, 761 S.W.2d 174, 176 (1988) (finding preemption under FEHBA); Hayes, supra, 819 F.2d at 926.\nInsofar as the Burkeys\u2019 claim for statutory delay damages necessarily refers to GEHA\u2019s plan to determine coverage and whether the proper claims handling process was followed, it refers to the plan, \u201crelates to\u201d it and is therefore preempted. Further, preemption is required because imposition of Louisiana's statutory penalties would invariably expand GEHA\u2019s obligations under the terms of its plan and would foster interstate conflicts in coverage.\nAs \u00a7 8902(m)(l) preempts the application of Louisiana\u2019s statutory penalty provision, so it also contradicts the trial court\u2019s sole reliance on Louisiana law, Fakouri v. Insurance Company of North America, 378 So.2d 1083 (La.App.1979), to determine that Mrs. Burkey furnished adequate notice of her claim to GEHA. The proper standard of coverage is whether Mrs. Bur-key\u2019s efforts to inform GEHA of her claim complied with the contractual provisions at issue. \u00a7 8902(m)(l). There is no dispute regarding these efforts, and they were legally sufficient under the contract. GEHA\u2019s plan established the following claims procedure:\nHOW TO FILE CLAIM\n1. After you have incurred covered expenses exceeding the deductible, submit a completed Form E-l Employee Statement of Claim for reimbursement of covered expenses in excess of the Deductible. Include copies of the bills with your claim to show that you met the Deductible. A separate claim form must be submitted for each covered family member.\n2. Submit an attending doctor\u2019s statement (Form S02). This form must be completed by the principal attending doctor and all items must be answered. If assignment authorizing direct payment to the doctor is desired you should complete and sign the upper portion of Form S-2. A Form S-2 need not be completed by any other attending doctor unless requested by the Plan.\n3. If you wish to authorize direct payment to a hospital, show your identification card upon admission. The hospital completes their own form or will send an itemized statement to the Government Employees Hospital Association (GEHA). If you do not wish to authorize direct payment to a hospital, see 4.\n4. Submit hospital and doctor bills itemized to show\u2014\nName of the person for whom service was rendered\nName of the attending doctor and/or admitting hospital\nDate charge was incurred, statement of the diagnosis or treatment given and amount of the charge.\nGEHA contends that Mrs. Burkey\u2019s E-l, prepared in June, 1982, was fatally incomplete because it included no bill for medical services rendered by Charity Hospital and no specific information on Carey\u2019s injury. Although this is correct as far as it goes, the trial court implicitly found, and we agree, that filing a \u201cclaim\u201d under the GEHA plan does not invariably require the attachment of medical bills. Further, Mrs. Burkey\u2019s E-l, taken together with her two letters in December 1982 \u2014 still within the period for filing a timely GEHA claim for December, 1981 services rendered to Carey \u2014 furnished sufficient information concerning the claim to require GEHA to investigate and inquire. It is both unrealistic and insensitive of GEHA to assert, as it implicitly does, that only a letter-perfect filled-in claim form, complete with exhibits, will satisfy its contractual claim filing procedures. The contract says no such thing. The evidence that Carey had been covered, that he had suffered a serious injury, and that he had just barely become 22 at the time of his hospitalization required GEHA, given the coverage provisions of its plan, to treat Mrs. Burkey\u2019s communications as a claim.\nIn this connection, we fully endorse the district court\u2019s comments:\nWe are not dealing with technicalities. It seems to me we\u2019re dealing here with matters of just plain common sense and human decency. Even a brief contact to this lady in response to her letters, if somebody had just read their mail, would have resolved the problem and none of us would [be] in this Court today.\nGEHA additionally argues that the Burkeys failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not seeking OPM review of GEHA\u2019s inaction pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.105 (1991). The Eleventh Circuit recently held that this regulation creates an exhaustion requirement. Kobleur v. Group Hospitalization and Med. Serv\u2019s, Inc., 954 F.2d 705, 709-10 (11th Cir.1992). While we generally agree with Kobleur, Kobleur arrives too late to affect the Bur-keys\u2019 case. The district court and the amicus brief filed by OPM properly conclude that applying an exhaustion doctrine now would be a waste of resources.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the above discussion, we vacate that portion of the judgment based on Louisiana\u2019s statutory penalty law and revise it downward to a total of $44,693 plus pre- and post-judgment interest. This judgment remains subject to the intervention award to DHHR, however.\nAFFIRMED in Part, REVERSED in Part.\n. GEHA argues that this letter referred not to the June, 1982 E-l, but to an earlier claim filed by Mrs. Burkey. The trial court found against GEHA on this point.\n. Prejudgment interest is authorized by West v. Harris, 573 F.2d 873, 882 (5th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 946, 99 S.Ct. 1424, 59 L.Ed.2d 635 (1979). Contrary to the Burkeys\u2019 request, costs cannot be awarded them at this late date because they did not timely request an award under the district court\u2019s rules. Local Rule 5.04E, Louisiana Uniform District Court Rules; Assoc. Builders and Contractors of La., Inc. v. Orleans Parish School Board, 919 F.2d 374, 380 (5th Cir.1990) (discussion the application of local rule 5.04(e) absent explicit federal preemption).\n. Compare Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida, Inc. v. Department of Banking & Finance, 791 F.2d 1501, 1505 (11th Cir.1986) (state law is preempted to the extent it conflicted with federal employees benefits); Myers v. United States, 767 F.2d 1072, 1074 (4th Cir.1985) (state law which purports to allow recovery of additional benefits not contemplated by federal insurance contract must be deemed inconsistent with and preempted by FEHBA); and Tackitt v. Prudential Insurance Co., 758 F.2d 1572, 1575 (11th Cir.1985) (\"the interpretation of health insurance contracts is controlled by federal, not state law\u201d) with Howard v. Group Hospital Service, 739 F.2d 1508, 1510-12 (10th Cir.1984) (approving state law interpretation of FEHBA provisions).\n. The timeliness of Mrs. Burkey's \u201cclaim\" is undisputed because of GEHA\u2019s liberal deadlines.",
