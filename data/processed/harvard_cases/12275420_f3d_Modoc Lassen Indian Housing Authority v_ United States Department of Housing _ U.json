        "text": "ORDER\nMORITZ, Circuit Judge.\nThese matters are before the court on the Petition for Rehearing or. Rehearing En Bane filed by Appellees in, numbers 14-1407 and 15-1060 and the Petition for Rehearing En Banc filed by Appellees in numbers 14-1313, 14-1331, 14-1338, 14-1340, and 14-1484.\nUpon consideration and in light of the parties\u2019 post-opinion factual stipulation that HUD has already repaid the Tribes, the panel grants in part the request for panel rehearing in numbers 14-1407.and 15-1060, but only to the, extent of the modifications contained in the attached revised Opinion. Judge Matheson would grant panel rehearing in full on the sovereign immunity issue in numbers 14-1407 and 15-1060. The Opinion and separate writings filed on July 25, 2017, are hereby withdrawn, and shall be replaced by the attache4 revised Opinion and separate writings. The Clerk is directed to file the revised Opinion and separate writings effective, the date of this order.\nThe revised Opinion and separate writings, the Petition for Rehearing or Rehearing En Banc filed by Appellees in numbers 14-1407 and 15-1060, and the Petition for Rehearing En Banc filed by Appellees.in numbers 14-1313,14-1331,14-1338, 14-1340, and 14-1484 were circulated to all of the judges of the court, who are in regular active service. As no member, of the panel and no judge in regular active service on the. court requested that the court be polled, the requests for en banc rehearing are denied pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 35.'\nThese consolidated appeals arise from a government agency\u2019s decision to recapture, via administrative offset, funds that the agency allegedly overpaid to multiple grant recipients. The grant: recipients brought suit in federal court, -arguing in relevant part\" that the agency lacked authority to recapture the funds without first providing them with administrative hearings. The district court agreed and ordered the agency to repay the grant recipients. The agency now appeals that order.\nIf these underlying facts sound relatively straightforward, it\u2019s because they are.' But they, nevertheless give rise t\u00f3 three legal questions that are decidedly less so: (1) did the agency recapture, the funds pursuant to a statute or regulation that imposed a hearing requirement, thus rendering the recaptures illegal; (2) if the agency didn\u2019t recapture the funds pursuant to such a statute or regulation, did it have authority to recapture the alleged overpayments at all; and (3) if not, could the district court order the agency to reimburse the grant recipients for the amounts it illegally collected?\nIn answering .the first of these three questions, the panel unanimously agrees that the agency didn\u2019t recapture the funds pursuant to a statute or regulation that imposes a hearing requirement. Thus, we agree that the district court erred in ruling that the recipients were entitled to hearings before the agency could recapture the alleged overpayments.\nBut that\u2019s where our unanimous agreement ends; the remaining questions divide the panel. Ultimately, two members of the panel agree that the agency lacked authority to recapture the funds via administrative offset. Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the district court\u2019s order that characterizes the recaptures as illegal. Nevertheless, two other members of the panel agree that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the district court lacked authority to order the agency to repay the recipients to the extent the agency had already redistributed or otherwise expended the recaptured funds. Thus, we reverse that portion of the district court\u2019s order and remand for further factual findings.\nI\nCongress enacted the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) of 1996, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4101-4243, to help Indian tribes provide affordable housing for their members, see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4101(5). To that end, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocates NA-HASDA grant funds among recipient tribes each year.\nIn determining how to allocate those funds, HUD employs a regulatory formula that takes into account each tribe\u2019s Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS)\u2014a figure calculated by multiplying the number of eligible low-rent housing units in that tribe\u2019s possession by a fixed dollar amount. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4152(a)(1); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1000.310(a), 1000.316. Critically, HUD relies on each tribe to provide an accurate yearly count of its eligible housing units. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1000.315(a), 1000.319(a). And because HUD allocates funds to all tribes from a finite yearly pool, see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4151, a tribe that erroneously reports an inflated number of eligible housing units will not only receive an overpayment, but will necessarily reduce the funds available to other eligible tribes. See Fort Belknap Hous. Dep\u2019t v. Office of Pub. & Indian Hous., 726 F.3d 1099, 1100 n.2 (9th Cir. 2013) (\u201cBecause the total amount of money available to all tribes is fixed, [NAHASDA funding] is a zero-sum game: Any change in one tribe\u2019s allocation requires an offsetting change to other tribes\u2019 allocations.\u201d).\nAppellees are various tribes (the Tribes) that allegedly inflated their eligible-unit counts\u2014and therefore allegedly received overpayments\u2014during various years. When HUD discovered these alleged over-payments, it recouped the funds by deducting them from the Tribes\u2019 subsequent yearly NAHASDA allocations. The Tribes then sued for the return of those funds.\nIn relevant part, the Tribes argued that HUD lacked authority to recapture the funds without first providing the Tribes with administrative hearings. The district court agreed. As a result, the court ordered HUD to restore the recaptured funds to the Tribes. HUD now appeals.\nII\nBecause these appeals arise under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706, \u201c[w]e take \u2018an independent review of [HUD\u2019s] action\u2019 and are not bound by the district court\u2019s factual findings or legal conclusions.\u201d Utah Envtl. Cong. v. Bosworth, 439 F.3d 1184, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Olenhouse v. Commodity Credit Corp., 42 F.3d 1560, 1569 n.16 (10th Cir. 1994)). We will \u201c \u2018set aside agency action if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)).\nOn appeal, HUD advances three challenges to the district court\u2019s ruling that HUD acted illegally by recapturing the funds without conducting administrative hearings. First, HUD asserts that it wasn\u2019t required to hold hearings before it recaptured the funds because the only statutes and regulations that might require hearings don\u2019t apply here. Second, HUD insists that in the absence of an applicable statute or regulation, it was instead empowered to recapture the alleged overpayments via administrative offset under the common-law doctrine of payment by mistake. Third, HUD states that even if it lacked common-law authority to recapture the alleged overpayments via administrative offset, the district court nevertheless erred in ordering HUD to return the alleged overpay-ments to the Tribes because\u2014with one exception\u2014such an order amounts to an award of \u201cmoney damages\u201d and therefore runs afoul of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.\nA\nIn concluding that the Tribes were entitled to hearings before HUD could recapture the alleged overpayments, the district court relied on the relevant versions of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532 and 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161(a)(1). HUD doesn\u2019t dispute that these provisions required it to provide administrative hearings under certain circumstances. Instead, HUD argues that those circumstances simply aren\u2019t present here. For the reasons discussed below, we agree. And because these provisions therefore don\u2019t apply to HUD\u2019s recapture of the alleged overpayments, neither do their hearing requirements.\ni\nUnder 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532 (1998), HUD had authority to \u201cmake appropriate adjustments in the amount of the annual grants under NAHASDA in accordance with ... findings\u201d that HUD made \u201cpursuant to reviews and audits under [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4165].\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(a) (1998). But before doing so, HUD had to first provide \u201ca hearing in accordance with [24 C.F.R.]' \u00a7 1000.540 \u201d 24 C.F.R; \u00a7 1000.532(b) (1998). Thus, the threshold question before us is whether HUD recaptured the alleged overpayments based on findings it made \u201cpursuant to reviews and audits under [\u00a7 4165]\u201d; if so, then the Tribes were entitled to \u201ca hearing in accordance with [24 C.F.R.] \u00a7 1000.540.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(a), (b) (1998).\nThe relevant versions of \u00a7\u25a0 4165 required HUD to undertake \u201csuch reviews and audits as may be necessary or appropriate\u201d to make three specific determinations: (1) whether each tribe \u201ccarried out its eligible activities in a timely manner, ... carried out its eligible activities and certifications in accordance with the requirements and the primary objectives of this chapter and with other applicable laws, and has a continuing capacity to carry out those activities in a timely manner\u201d; (2) whether each tribe \u201ccomplied with [its] Indian housing plan\u201d; and (3) whether each tribe\u2019s \u201cperformance reports ... [were] accurate.\u201d \u00a7 4165(a) (1998); see \u00a7 4165(b) (2006).\nBoth the Ninth Circuit and the Court of Federal Claims have held that when HUD reviews a tribe\u2019s report of its eligible housing stock, that review falls within the scope of the first of these three categories, i.e., within HUD\u2019s authority to review a tribe\u2019s activities and certifications. See Crow Tribal Hous. Auth. v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 781 F.3d 1095, 1103 (9th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[W]e conclude HUD\u2019s ... FCAS review constituted .an audit within the meaning of \u00a7 4165 to determine whether the Tribe had carried out \u2018eligible activities and certification in accordance with this chapter and other applicable law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting \u00a7 4165(b)(l)(A)(i)(II))); Lummi Tribe of Lummi Reservation v. United States, 106 Fed.Cl. 623, 630 (2012) (\u201cSuch a review, we believe, comes within [\u00a7 4165\u2019s] broad mandate, .to ensure that the grant program is being conducted in accordance with NA-HASDA.\u201d (citing \u00a7 4165(b)(l)(A)(i)(II))>.\nBut as HUD points out, Crow doesn\u2019t acknowledge that \u201celigible activities\u201d and \u201ccertifications\u201d are defined terms\u2014let alone discuss whether, as defined, those terms encompass a tribe\u2019s report of its eligible housing stock. Instead, in concluding that HUD\u2019s. review of a tribe\u2019s reported eligible housing units constitutes a review or audit for purposes of .\u00a7 4165, Crow explicitly states that (1) \u201cNAHASDA does not define \u2018eligible activities and certification,\u2019\u201d and (2) \u201cit is ambiguous whether the term encompasses\u201d such reviews. 781 F.3d at 1103 (quoting \u00a7 4165(b)(l)(A)(i)(II)). Crow then resolves this alleged ambiguity by applying the Indian , canon, which states that \u201c[statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.\u201d Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Cty. of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation, 502 U.S. 251, 269, 112 S.Ct. 683, 116 L.Ed.2d 687 (1992)). Likewise, L/ummi concludes that HUD\u2019s review of a tribe\u2019s eligible housing units falls within HUD\u2019s authority to determine whether that tribe has carried out eligible activities without ever addressing what those eligible activities might be. See 106 Fed.Cl. at 630.\nWe decline to take this approach. Instead, we agree with HUD that the applicable. statutes unambiguously establish that the terms \u201celigible activities\u201d and \u201ccertifications\u201d don\u2019t encompass a tribe\u2019s report oh its eligible housing units. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4132 (1998) (explaining that eligible housing activities include housing assistance, development, housing services, housing management services, crime prevention, safety activities, and model activities); id. \u00a7 4112(c)(5) (listing certifications); id. \u00a7 4114(b)(1) (requiring certification regarding labor standards); id. \u00a7 4115(c)- (requiring environmental certification).\nWe see nothing in these statutes pertaining to a tribe\u2019s report of its eligible housing units. And because these statutes therefore unambiguously resolve this issue, we see no need to apply the Indian canon. Accordingly, we part ways\u2019 with both the Ninth Circuit and the Court of Federal Claims to the extent those courts have held that when HUD reviews a tribe\u2019s report of its eligible housing stock, that review falls within the scope of HUD\u2019s authority to review or audit a tribe\u2019s activities and certifications. See \u25a0 \u00a7 4165(a)(1) (1998); \u00a7 4165(b)(l)(A)(i)(II) (2006).\nFor similar reasons, we rejeet the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 conclusion that HUD\u2019s review of a tribe\u2019s report on its eligible housing units falls within the second and third categories of HUD\u2019s \u00a7 4165 authority, i.e., within HUD\u2019s authority to review or audit a tribe\u2019s Indian housing plan or its performance reports. See \u00a7 4165(a)(2), (3) (1998); \u00a7 4165(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B) (2006); see also Lummi, 106 Fed.Cl. at 630 (reading \u00a7 4165 \u201cas conferring broad authority on the Secretary to review a grant recipient\u2019s performance under NAHASDA, including monitoring a grant recipient\u2019s compliance with its Indian housing plan and verifying the \u00e1ccuracy of the recipient\u2019s performance reports\u201d). Again, nothing in the relevant statutes suggests that either a tribe\u2019s Indian housing plan or its performance'reports must (or even may) include information about the number of eligible housing\u2019units in that tribe\u2019s possession. See \u00a7 4112 (1998). (discussing Indian housing plans); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 (1998) (discussing performance reports). Instead, \u201c[t]he Formula Response Form is the only mechanism that a recipient shall use to report changes to the number of FCAS.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.315(b).\nIn short, reviewing,a tribe\u2019s-report on its eligible housing units doesn\u2019t fall within any of \u00a7 4165\u2019s three defined categories of audit-and-review authority. Accordingly, HUD didn\u2019t recapture the alleged overpayments at issue here based on findings HUD made \u201cpursuant to reviews and audits under [\u00a7 4165].\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(a) (1998). And that means HUD was under no obligation to afford any of the Tribes \u201ca hearing- in accordance with [24 C.F.R.] \u00a7 1000.540\u201d under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(b) (1998).\nii\nAlternatively, the Tribes argue that even if they weren\u2019t entitled to hearings under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(b) (1998), they were nevertheless entitled to hearings under \u00a7 4161 (1998). For two reasons, we again disagree.\na\nIn relevant part, \u00a7 4161 (1998) provides,\n[I]f the Secretary finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a recipient of assistance under this chapter has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall\u2014\n(1) terminate payments under this chapter to the recipient;\n(2) reduce payments under this chapter to the recipient by an amount equal to the amount of such payments that were not expended in accordance with this chapter;\n(3) limit the availability of payments under this chapter to programs, projects, or activities not affected by such failure to comply; or\n(4) in the case of noncompliance described in section 4162(b) of this title, provide a replacement tribally designated housing entity for the recipient, under section 4162 of this title.\n\u00a7 4161(a) (1998).\nAccording to the Tribes, \u00a7 4161(a) (1998)\u2019s hearing requirement applies here because HUD \u201creduce[d]\u201d the Tribes\u2019 NA-HASDA payments under \u00a7 4161(a)(2) (1998). But \u00a7 4161(a)(2) (1998) only applies when HUD \u201creduce[s] payments\u201d to a tribe \u201cby an amount equal to the amount of such payments that were not expended in accordance with\u201d NAHASDA. \u00a7 4161(a)(2) (1998) (emphasis added). And as HUD notes, it has never suggested or alleged that the Tribes \u201cexpended\u201d the alleged overpayments in such a manner. Id. Instead, HUD alleged only that the Tribes\u2019 wrongly received the alleged over-payments.\nRelying on City of Boston v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 898 F.2d 828 (1st Cir. 1990), the Tribes characterize HUD\u2019s emphasis on \u00a7 4161(a)(2) (1998)\u2019s use of the term \u201cexpended\u201d as \u201chyper-technical,\u201d Aplee. Br. 31 (quoting Boston, 898 F.2d at 832).\nIn Boston, the statute at issue required HUD to provide a hearing before it \u201cterminate[d] ... payments\u201d to the grant recipient. 898 F.2d at 831. And HUD argued that because the grant recipient hadn\u2019t yet \u201creceived any funds ... there was no \u2018termination\u2019 of \u2018payments.\u2019\u201d Id. The First Circuit rejected this \u201chyper-technical\u201d interpretation of the statute. Id. at 832. But in doing so, it relied on other language in the statute at issue\u2014language that suggested Congress was concerned with \u201cwithhold[ing] relevant funding whenever a recipient ... failed to comply with the controlling law,\u201d regardless of \u201c[wjhether the promised payments ha[d] or ha[d] not begun.\u201d Id. Here, the Tribes point to no similar language that suggests Congress, in drafting \u00a7 4161, was concerned with money that the Tribes wrongfully received, as opposed to money they wrongfully expended. Accordingly, the Tribes\u2019 reliance on Boston is misplaced.\nSo too is their reliance on Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 861 F.2d 739 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Tribes assert that, in Kansas City, the court treated as applicable a statute that allowed HUD to \u201creduce [grant] payments to the recipient ... by an amount equal to the amount of such payments which were not expended\u201d properly, 861 F.2d at 740 (emphasis added) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (1982))\u2014even though \u201c[t]here was no allegation of unlawful expenditure^,\u201d Aplee. Br. 31.\nBut it doesn\u2019t appear that either the parties or the court in Kansas City addressed any possible distinction between expending funds and receiving them. In fact, the Tribes acknowledge as much in arguing that Kansas City \u201cimplicitly\u201d resolves this issue. Aplee. Br. 30. \u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\u201d Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S.Ct. 148, 69 L.Ed. 411 (1925). Thus, we decline to rely on Kansas City\u2019s \u201cimplicit ]\u201d answer to the question of \u00a7 4161\u2019s applicability. Aplee. Br. 30.\nInstead, we adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s explicit answer to this precise question. When HUD alleges only that a tribe incorrectly received funding\u2014but makes \u201cno determination on whether any NA-HASDA funds [were] improperly expended\u201d\u2014HUD doesn\u2019t \u201cact under \u00a7 4161, and, accordingly,\u201d isn\u2019t subject to \u00a7 4161\u2019s hearing requirement. Crow Tribal Hous. Auth., 781 F.3d at 1102 & n.5 (emphasis added); cf. Fort Belknap Hous. Dep\u2019t, 726 F.3d at 1106 (holding that \u00a7 4161 wasn\u2019t implicated where HUD alleged only that tribe wrongly received funding for ineligible housing units, not that tribe expended those funds in manner that wasn\u2019t \u201cin accordance with\u201d NAHASDA (quoting \u00a7 4161(a)(1)(B))). And because HUD has never challenged the Tribes expenditures of the alleged overpayments, we agree with HUD that the Tribes weren\u2019t entitled to hearings under \u00a7 4161 (1998).\nb\nAlternatively, even if we agreed with the Tribes that there exists no meaningful distinction between receiving funds and expending them, we would nevertheless conclude that \u00a7 4161 (1998) doesn\u2019t apply to HUD\u2019s recapture of the alleged overpayments.\nIn relevant part, \u00a7 4161 (1998) provides, \u201c[I]f the Secretary finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a recipient of assistance under this chapter has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall,\u201d e.g., \u201creduce payments ... to the recipient.\u201d \u00a7 4161(a)(2) (1998) (emphasis added). According to HUD, it has never suggested that the Tribes\u2019 alleged inflation of their eligible housing units constitutes substantial noncompliance. Thus, HUD concludes, \u00a7 4161 doesn\u2019t apply. Cf. Fort Belknap Hous. Dep\u2019t, 726 F.3d at 1104 (holding that applicable version of \u00a7 4161 didn\u2019t apply where \u201cHUD neither alleged nor found\u201d substantial noncompliance).\nTo support this argument, HUD points out that Congress amended \u00a7 4161 in 2008 to clarify that a recipient\u2019s failure \u201cto comply with the requirements ... regarding the reporting of low-income dwelling units shall not, in itself, be considered to be substantial noncompliance.\u201d Pub. L. No. 110-411, \u00a7 4161(2), 122 Stat 4319. HUD asserts that this amendment amounts to a clarification rather than a substantive change. Thus, HUD concludes, the amendment applies retrospectively to HUD\u2019s pre-2008 recaptures of the alleged over-payments. See Dobbs v. Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield (Dobbs II), 600 F.3d 1275, 1282 (10th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[A] true clarification applies retrospectively.\u201d).\nIn determining whether the 2008 amendment applies retrospectively, we begin by asking whether \u201cCongress has expressly prescribed the proper reach\u201d of that amendment. Id. To that end, HUD points out that a Senate Report subtitle explicitly refers to the 2008 amendment as a \u201c[cjlarification.\u201d S. Rep. No. 110-238, at 10 (2007).\nBy \u201cus[ing] ... the term \u2018clarification\u2019\u2019\u201d in the 2008 amendment\u2019s legislative history, Congress unambiguously expressed \u201can intent that the amendment apply retrospectively.\u201d Dobbs II, 600 F.3d at 1282; see Dobbs v. Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield (Dobbs I), 475 F.3d 1176, 1178 (10th Cir. 2007) (remanding to district court to apply amended statutory language where \u201camendment\u2019s legislative history suggested] that Congress expanded [relevant] definition to clarify ... legal ambiguity\u201d); cf. Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 59 n.10, 100 S.Ct. 318, 62 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979) (accepting Senate Report\u2019s indication that amendment constituted \u201ca clarification rather than a substantive change in the reach of the law\u201d); Danielson v. Flores (In re Flores), 735 F.3d 855, 860-61 (9th Cir. 2013) (relying on' title of House Report to interpret ambiguous statute).\nIn fact, as HUD points out, the Ninth Circuit has already relied on the language of this same Senate Report to conclude that (1) \u201cthe 2008 amendment was a clarification, not a substantive change to\u201d \u00a7 4161, and (2) the amendment therefore applies retrospectively. Crow, 781 F.3d at 1101. We agree with the Ninth Circuit on this point, and we conclude that the Tribes\u2019 failure to accurately report their eligible housing units, standing alone, doesn\u2019t constitute substantial noncompliance. See \u00a7 4161(a)(2) (2009) (\u201cThe failure of a recipient to comply with the requirements of [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4152(b)(1)] regarding the reporting of low-income dwelling units shall not, in itself, be considered to be substantial noncompliance for purposes of this subchapter.\u201d).\nBecause we see no indication that HUD ever suspected or alleged substantial noncompliance on the part of the Tribes, we conclude that HUD didn\u2019t act pursuant to \u00a7 4161 (1998)\u2014and therefore wasn\u2019t subject to \u00a7 4161 (1998)\u2019s hearing requirement\u2014when it recouped the alleged over-payments. See Crow, 781 F.3d at 1101-02 (holding that HUD didn\u2019t \u201cact under \u00a7 4161, and, accordingly, could not have violated a hearing requirement under that section,\u201d when HUD never alleged substantial noncompliance).\nB\nFor the reasons discussed above, we agree with HUD that it didn\u2019t act under \u00a7 4161 (1998) or 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532 (1998) when\" it recaptured the funds. But this conclusion is a double-edged sword. True, it resolves one question in HUD\u2019s favor: it means the district court erred in ruling that HUD was required to provide hearings before recouping the funds. But it raises a second, more fundamental question: in the absence of an applicable statute or regulation, what gave HUD the authority to recoup the funds at all? See Killip v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 991 F.2d 1564, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (explaining that federal agencies are \u201ccreature[s] of statute\u201d); see also Michigan v. EPA, 268 F.3d 1075, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f there is no statute conferring authority, a federal agency has none.\u201d).\nIn attempting to answer that question, HUD asserts that rather than proceeding under a statute, it recaptured the funds by using \u201cits longstanding, common-law authority to recover- payments made by mistake.\u201d Aplt. Br. 27. As support for this argument, HUD cites six cases. None of them apply here.\nOf the six cases that HUD cites, only the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Fort Belk- nap even arguably addresses whether a government agency administering a grant program can rely on this common-law right to unilaterally recover overpayments from a beneficiary. And the Ninth Circuit itself has since characterized this portion of Fort Belknap as dicta. See Crow Tribal Hous. Auth., 781 F.8d at 1105 n. 9. We agree. The question in Fort Belknap wasn\u2019t whether HUD had common-law authority to recoup NAHASDA overpay-ments. Instead, the \u201cnarrow issue resolved in Fort Belknap was whether [the Ninth Circuit] had jurisdiction to consider the tribe\u2019s direct appeal.\u201d Id, at 1104. And that question turned solely on whether HUD acted under \u00a7 4161(a)\u2014not on whether HUD had authority to act pursuant' to some common-law right. See Fort Belknap, 726 F.3d at 1100.\nThe next three cases that HUD cites are likewise unhelpful. They stand only for the limited proposition that the government has a right, even in the absence of express statutory authority, to sue to collect over-payments. See United States v. Wurts, 303 U.S. 414, 416, 58 S.Ct. 637, 82 L.Ed. 932 (1938) (citing \u201c[government\u2019s long-established right to sue for money wrongfully or erroneously paid from the public treasury\u201d); United States v. Lahey Clinic Hosp., Inc., 399 F.3d 1, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting \u201cgovernment\u2019s right to sue\u201d to \u201crecover monies wrongly paid from the Treasury, even absent any express statutory authorization\u201d); LTV Educ. Sys., Inc. v. Bell, 862 F.2d 1168, 1169-70, 1175 (5th Cir. 1989) (citing government\u2019s authority to \u201crecover money it mistakenly, erroneously, or illegally paid\u201d where Department of Education sued based on alleged violation of federal regulation). Because HUD opted instead to unilaterally recoup the overpay-ments, rather'than to sue for their, return, these cas\u00e9s are inapposite.\nThat leaves only United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 236, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947), and Grand Trunk Western Railway Co. v. United States, 252 U.S. 112, 117, 40 S.Ct. 309, 64 L.Ed. 484 (1920).\nAt first glance, Grand Tnmk appears to support HUD\u2019s assertion that it enjoys common-law authority to recover overpay-ments via administrative offset. There, the Court held that the Postmaster General \u201cwas under no obligation to . establish the [alleged overpayment] by suit.\u201d 252 U.S. at 120-21, 40 S.Ct. 309. Instead, \u201c[h]aving satisfied himself\u2019 of the alleged overpayment, \u201che was at liberty to deduct the amount of the overpayment from the moneys otherwise payable to the company to which the overpayment had been made.\u201d Id.\nBut in Grand Trunk, the government didn\u2019t mistakenly overpay the beneficiary of a grant and then withhold the amount-of the overpayment- from that beneficiary\u2019s future-year grant funds, as HUD did here. Instead, the overpayments in Grand Trunk arose in the context of a contractual relationship between the government and the plaintiff: the government entered into a series of \u201csuccessive -quadrennial contracts\u201d under which \u201cthe mails were carried over\u201d a certain stretch of the plaintiffs railroad. Id. at 117, 121, 40 S.Ct. 309. And when the Postmaster General realized that the government had previously overpaid the plaintiff for its use of that stretch of its track, he simp\u00edy \u201cdeducted] the amount of the overpayment\u201d from the amount the government owed \u201cunder the current contract.\u201d Id. The plaintiff sued, the Court of Claims dismissed, and the Supreme Court affirmed. Id. at 117, 40 S.Ct. 309.\nProperly limited to its facts, Grand Trunk establishes that when the government enters into a series of contracts with a private party, it can deduct any amount it erroneously overpays that private party \u201cby means of a later debit\u201d to the parties\u2019 \u201crunning accounts.\u201d Id. at 121, 40 S.Ct. 309. But this appeal doesn\u2019t arise from a contractual relationship. Instead, it arises from a grant program designed to help the Tribes and their members \u201cimprove then-housing conditions and socioeconomic status.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4101(5). And Congress explicitly acknowledged in enacting that grant program that \u201cthe United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people.\u201d \u00a7 4101(3).\nThat unique relationship sets this case apart from both Grand Trunk and Munsey Trust, which also arose from a series of contracts. See Munsey Tr., 332 U.S. at 236-39, 67 S.Ct. 1599; Richard B. Cappalli, Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements: Law, Policy, and Practice \u00a7 8:15, at 81 (1991 Cum. Supp.) (explaining that \u201ctraditional contract principles are inapro-pos to an understanding of assistance rights and responsibilities\u201d in context of grant funding); cf. Md. Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., 762 F.2d 406, 409 (4th Cir. 1985) (rejecting argument that court should apply \u201ccontractual principles\u201d to federal-grant program, and explaining that grant programs are instead \u201cgoverned by the applicable statute[s] and implementing regulations\u201d).\nAs these authorities suggest, the rules that traditionally govern contractual relationships don\u2019t necessarily apply in the context of federal grant programs. See, e.g., Cappalli, \u00a7 8:15, at 80-81 (distinguishing between contracts and grants; explaining that grantor rights\u2014including right to recapture funds\u2014\u201cmust emanate explicitly or implicitly from the grant statutes, regulations duly enacted and consistent with the statute being implemented, or provisions in the grant agreement\u201d; and noting that it\u2019s \u201cunfair to subject the grantee to unannounced and undefined sanctions and remedies\u201d in absence of such provisions). Based on the government\u2019s \u201cunique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people,\u201d \u00a7 4101(3), we think it would be particularly \u201cunfair,\u201d Cappalli, \u00a7 8:15, at 80, to apply common-law contract principles to HUD\u2019s recapture of NAHASDA funds. Thus, neither Grand Trunk nor Munsey Tmst can support the weight of HUD\u2019s common-law-authority argument.\nAccordingly, we hold that the district court properly rejected HUD\u2019s common-law-authority argument. And because HUD hasn\u2019t advanced on appeal any alternative basis for its authority to recapture the funds via administrative offset, we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that HUD acted illegally by recapturing the alleged overpayments.\nC\nBut this victory for the Tribes is largely a hollow one. That\u2019s because HUD enjoys sovereign immunity from claims for money damages. See Utah ex rel. Utah Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality v. EPA, 765 F.3d 1257, 1260 (10th Cir. 2014) (explaining that suits against federal agencies are barred by sovereign immunity absent a specific waiver of that immunity); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (waiving sovereign immunity for claims against agencies, but only for suits \u201cseeking relief other than money damages\u201d (emphasis added)). And at least some of the district court\u2019s orders directing HUD to repay the Tribes appear to award money damages.\nThe crux of the Tribes\u2019 claims is this: HUD wrongfully decreased their NAHAS-DA funding in various years by subtracting (1) the amount of any alleged overpay-ments the Tribes received in previous years from (2) the amounts to which the Tribes would have otherwise been entitled in subsequent years. For instance, HUD concluded that the Choctaw received over-payments in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. HUD then deducted those alleged over-payments from the NAHASDA funding that the Choctaw otherwise would have received in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Thus, what the Choctaw sought was return of-the 2003,- 2004, and 2005 funding that-HUD wrongfully withheld.\nBut the district court didn\u2019t order HUD to repay the Tribes until many years after HUD recaptured the alleged, overpay-ments, For instance, the court didn\u2019t order HUD to repay the Choctaw until 2014\u2014 approximately a decade after HUD withheld the relevant funds. And perhaps because it recognized the distinct possibility that HUD had long since distributed all of the funds from Congress\u2019 2003, 2004, and 2005 NAHASDA appropriations, the court ordered HUD to repay the Choctaw \u201cfrom all available sources,\u201d including (1) funds that were \u201ccarried[ ] forward from previous fiscal years\u201d and (2) funds that were \u201cappropriated in future grant years.\u201d App. vol. 12, 2463.\nCiting this aspect of the district court\u2019s order, HUD asserts that the court awarded the Tribes money damages in violation of \u00a7 702. We agree.\nThe phrase \u201cmoney damages\u201d \u201crefers to a sum of money used as compensatory relief. Damages are given to the plaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss, whereas specific remedies \u2018are not substitute remedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.\u2019 \u201d Dep\u2019t of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 262, 119 S.Ct. 687, 142 L.Ed.2d 718 (1999) (quoting Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 895, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988)).\nHere, the district court awarded the Tribes money damages when it ordered HUD to compensate them using funds from grant years other than the grant years during which HUD wrongfully collected the alleged overpayments. For instance, the \u201cvery thing\u201d to which the Choctaw said it was entitled was additional funding from Congress\u2019 2003, 2004, and 2005 NAHASDA appropriations. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. at 262, 119 S.Ct. 687 (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895, 108 S.Ct. 2722). But to the extent that HUD had already distributed the funds from those yearly appropriations to other tribes, HUD couldn\u2019t have possibly returned those funds to the Tribes. Thus, the district court instead ordered HUD to pay the Tribes by \u201csubstituting]\u201d other funds for the funds to which the Tribes were actually entitled\u2014i.e., funds from past-or future-year NAHASDA appropriations. Id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895, 108 S.Ct. 2722).\nThis distinction may seem pedantic. After all, money is money. And surely the Tribes don\u2019t care whether HUD repaid them using funds that remained from 2003\u2019s NAHASDA appropriation, or if it instead repaid them from some other source. But \u201cthe fungibility [of] money\u201d can easily \u201cobscure[]\u201d the difference between (1) \u201crelief that seeks' to compensate a plaintiff for a harm -by providing a substitute for the loss,\u201d Cty. of Suffolk v. Sebelius, 605 F.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir. 2010) (emphases omitted), and (2) \u201crelief that requires a defendant to transfer a specific res-to the plaintiff,\u201d id.\nTo understand how that distinction operates to preclude relief here, assume for a moment that instead of withholding funds for affordable housing from a particular tribe, HUD instead wrongfully withheld from that tribe an actual house\u2014a house that HUD then gave to another eligible tribe.\nBecause that specific house is no longer in HUD\u2019s possession, the district court can\u2019t order HUD to turn it over to the tribe that should have originally received it. Instead, the best the district court can do is order HUD to give that tribe the house\u2019s monetary equivalent. And that monetary equivalent amounts to substitute relief\u2014i.e., money damages. See Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. at 262, 119 S.Ct. 687; cf. Clymore v. United States, 415 F.3d 1113, 1118, 1120 (10th Cir. 2005) (remanding for findings regarding whether government still had in its possession the \u201cfour items seized from [plaintiff] at the time of his arrest\u201d; \u201cto the extent the government [was] no longer in possession of\u2019 plaintiffs property and plaintiff thus instead sought \u201cmonetary relief, sovereign immunity bar[red] his claim\u201d).\nIf sovereign immunity would bar the district court from ordering HUD to provide the tribe in this hypothetical scenario with \u201cthe cash equivalent\u201d of the wrongfully withheld house, it likewise barred the district court from ordering HUD to provide the Tribes with the \u201ccash equivalent\u201d of the wrongfully withheld overpayments. Diaz v. United States, 517 F.3d 608, 611 (2d Cir. 2008); cf. id. at 612-13 (holding that doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded court from ordering government to pay \u201cmonetary equivalent\u201d of seized currency, which could \u201cno longer be identified or located in the coffers of the government\u201d; reasoning that \u201ccurrency should be treated like any other seized property: if the property is no longer available, sovereign immunity bars the claimant from seeking compensation\u201d).\nAnd this rationale\u2014i.e,, the idea that courts should treat money like any other form of property for sovereign-immunity purposes\u2014explains why two of our sister circuits have found the distinction between original funds and substitute funds disposi-tive in cases involving yearly grant appropriations. See Suffolk, 605 F.3d at 141 (explaining that because the \u201cres at issue is identified by reference to the congressional appropriation that authorized the agency\u2019s challenged expenditure,\u201d a claim seeking,, funds from any other source \u201cseek[s] compensation rather than the specific property the plaintiff aims to recover,\u201d and therefore \u201cfalls outside the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity arising from \u00a7 702\u201d); see also City of Houston v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1428 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (\u201cAn award of monetary relief from any source of funds other than the [relevant fiscal year] appropriation would constitute money damages rather than specific relief, and so' would not be authorized by [\u00a7 702].\u201d); cf. Am.'s Cmty. Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 830 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (discussing Houston and reiterating that HUD\u2019s \u201ccommitment of the appropriated [grant] funds to other recipients and the expiration of the congressional appropriation\u201d in Houston rendered \u201can award from other available HUD funds ... money damages as opposed to specific relief\u2019).\nThe Tribes attempt to distinguish the facts in Houston and Suffolk from the facts here. First, they point out that HUD treats NAHASDA funds as interchangeable from year to year, by, e.g., \u201cus[ing] funds appropriated in fiscal years 1998-2008 both to augment underfunding in pri- or' fiscal years and to supplement funds appropriated in subsequent fiscal years.\u201d Aplee. Br. 75-76.\nThe Tribes appear to suggest that by treating NAHASDA funds as interchangeable from year to year, HUD somehow implicitly waived its sovereign immunity against claims for money damages. But \u201c[a] waiver of sovereign immunity \u2018cannot be implied\u2019 it \u201cmust be unequivocally expressed.\u201d United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) (quoting United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969)). Thus, to the extent that HUD shuffles NAHASDA funding between years, that fact is only relevant if by virtue of such shuffling, funds from the relevant yearly appropriations remained at HUD\u2019s disposal when the district court ordered it to repay the Tribes. If not, then the district court\u2019s order constituted an order to provide \u201cmoney damages rather than specific relief, and so [it wasn\u2019t] authorized by [\u00a7 702].\u201d Houston, 24 F.3d at 1428.\nIn a related argument, the Tribes note that NAHASDA appropriations are \u201c \u2018no-year\u2019 appropriations.\u201d Aplee. Br. 74. And \u201c[a] no-year appropriation is available for obligation without fiscal year limitation.\u201d 1 U.S. General Accounting Office, Office of the General Counsel, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, at 5-6 (2d ed. 1991). Thus, the Tribes assert, the \u201cres\u201d at issue here \u201cis the sum of all NAHASDA appropriations, carried forward and backward as they may be.\u201d Aplee. Br. 78 (emphasis added).\nBut the Houston court rejected a very similar argument. There, the district court ruled that \u201cthe lapse of the appropriation from which fiscal 1986 [grant] monies were drawn meant that there were no funds available from which HUD could lawfully repay\u201d the plaintiff. 24 F.3d at 1424. The plaintiff challenged this ruling on appeal, arguing that HUD could nevertheless repay it by using \u201c\u2018no-year\u2019 funds that [were] not reserved for use in any particular year or for particular projects.\u201d Id. at 1428. The D.C. Circuit disagreed, reasoning that those \u201cno-year\u201d funds constituted \u201c[a]n award of monetary relief from a[] source of funds other than the 1986 ... appropriation.\u201d Id.\nSo too here. Thus, to the extent the district court ordered HUD to repay the Tribes \u201cfrom all available sources,\u201d e.g., App. vol. 12, 2463, we hold that those orders constitute awards of money damages unless HUD had at its disposal sufficient funds from the relevant yearly appropriations. Accordingly, we reverse in part and remand to the district court for factual findings regarding whether, at the time of the district court\u2019s order, HUD had the relevant funds at its disposal.\n* * *\nIn resolving this appeal, our divided panel unanimously agrees on one thing: the district court erred in ruling that a statute or regulation applies to render HUD\u2019s recapture of the alleged overpay-ments sans hearings illegal. But beyond that, unanimous agreement eludes us. Instead, we form two different majorities in answering the other two questions this appeal presents.\nTwo members of the panel agree that the only potential alternative source of authority HUD identifies on appeal is its common-law right to recover payments made by mistake. And because the same two members of the panel agree that this common-law right doesn\u2019t apply under the circumstances present here, we conclude that HUD lacked authority to recapture the funds. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it characterizes the recaptures as illegal.\nBut two other members of this panel agree that even if HUD illegally recaptured the funds, the doctrine of sovereign immunity nevertheless precluded the district court from ordering HUD to repay the Tribes. Thus, with one exception, we reverse the portion of the district court\u2019s order that directs HUD to repay the Tribes and remand for factual findings regarding whether any of the recaptured funds remained in HUD\u2019s possession when the district court ordered it to repay the Tribes.\n. In resolving the parties\u2019 various arguments, the district court actually entered several separate orders. For simplicity, we treat them as a single order and refer to them as such.\n. More specifically, the appellees are the Tribes' housing authorities. For purposes of these appeals, we treat each tribe and its housing authority as interchangeable.\n. Although neither the Tribes nor HUD assert as much in their initial briefs, they both maintain in post-opinion briefing that HUD has already complied with this order by repaying the Tribes. But even in their post-opinion briefing, neither the Tribes nor HUD provide us with any citations to the record that might support this factual assertion. True, the Tribes provide record citations that demonstrate the district court ordered HUD to repay the Tribes. But none of those citations demonstrate that HUD actually complied with the court\u2019s order. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring argument section of appellant's brief to contain \"appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the ... parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d); Fed. R. App. P. 28(b) (requiring ap-pellee\u2019s brief to \"conform to the requirements of\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)).\nNevertheless, despite the parties\u2019 failure to comply with Rule 28\u2019s requirements, we accept their joint factual stipulation on this point. Cf. Creative Consumer Concepts, Inc. v. Kreisler, 563 F.3d 1070, 1078 n.3 (10th Cir. 2009) (noting that \"we will honor stipulations to evidentiary facts\u201d). Finally, we note that neither party suggests this procedural fact calls into question HUD\u2019s ability to appeal the district court\u2019s order. On the contrary, HUD asserts in post-petition briefing that it specifically informed the Tribes that it was reserving its right to appeal despite its compliance with the district court's order. And although HUD doesn\u2019t provide a record citation to support this factual assertion, the Tribes have never suggested that HUD\u2019s compliance with the district court\u2019s order implicates its right to appeal.\n. HUD also argues that it didn\u2019t act arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that the Tribes misreported the number of eligible housing units in their possession. But even assuming HUD is correct on this point, we conclude that HUD nevertheless lacked authority to recapture the alleged overpayments. Accordingly, we need not address this argument.\n. More specifically, a \"recipient [could] request ... a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 1000.540\u201d if the dispute was \"not resolved\u201d via an \"informal meeting.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(b) (1998). Because neither party suggests that the matter of the alleged over-payments was ' \"resolved\u201d via an \u201cinformal meeting\u201d or that the Tribes didn\u2019t request hearings, id., we don\u2019t address those possibilities.\n. Because we conclude that neither \u00a7 4165 (1998) nor 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532 (1998) applies to HUD\u2019s recapture of the funds, we reject the Tribes\u2019 argument that those provisions operated to bar HUD from recapturing the funds at all\u2014with or without a hearing\u2014 unless HUD first demonstrated that the Tribes hadn\u2019t already spent those funds on affordable housing activities. See, e.g., \u00a7 4165(c) (1998) (allowing HUD to \"adjust, reduce, or withdraw grant amounts, or take other action as appropriate in accordance with the reviews and audits ... under this section, except that grant amounts. already expended oh affordable housing activities may not be recaptured or deducted from future assistance provided on behalf of an Indian tribe,\u201d); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1000.532(a) (1998) (same).\n. HUD cites additional cases in its reply brief, But like the cases that HUD cites in its opening brief, these additional cases simply don\u2019t address or implicate the specific factual scenario we face here.\n. Judge Bacharach asserts that \"five federal appellate courts have interpreted Wurts to allow offset without the need for suit.\u201d Op. of Bacharach, X, 4 & n.2. But none of the cases he cites address whether the federal government enjoys common-law authority to recoup funds via administrative offset in the context of a grant program. And'for reasons we discuss below, that distinction makes a difference,\n. Judge Bacharach suggests that if HUD. doesn\u2019t enjoy common-law authority to recoup the overpayments by administrative offset, this leaves \"a gap in NAHASDA\u201d that HUD necessarily enjoys implicit \"authority to fill.\u201d Op. of Bacharach, J., 8-9. But HUD has never advanced such an implicit-authority argument\u2014either below or on appeal. Thus, it has waived reliance on any implied-authority theory as a basis for reversal. See Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099, 1104-05 (10th Cir. 2007) (finding waived and declining to address argument that appellant failed to \u201cadequately raise and pursue\u201d in opening brief); see also Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 243, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008) (\u201c[W]e rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.\u201d (emphasis added)).\nIn any event, even assuming it would be appropriate for us to sua sponte reach this issue, the cases that Judge Bacharach cites in support of his implicit-authority theory indicate only that HUD enjoys authority to fill gaps in NAHASDA by promulgating rules and regulations. See id. at 9; Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\"If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.\" (emphasis added)); Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) (\u201cThe power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created and funded program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u201d (emphasis added)); Morrow v. Clayton, 326 F.2d 36, 45 (10th Cir. 1963) (\"We think the promulgation of the regulation by the Secretary was a lawful exercise of the power and authority vested in him [by statute] to administer the program ....\" (emphasis added)). Yet Judge Bachar-ach doesn't identify a rule or regulation that would allow HUD to recoup overpayments by administrative offset. Neither does HUD. Thus, even assuming that \"Congress implicitly delegated to HUD the authority to fill [NA-HASDA\u2019s] statutory gap\u201d by promulgating such a regulation, Op. of Bacharach, J., 10, it doesn\u2019t appear that HUD exercised that implicit authority here. Accordingly, even if it were appropriate for us to raise this theory sua sponte, see Greenlaw, 554 U.S. at 243, 128 S.Ct. 2559, it wouldn\u2019t provide a basis for reversal.\nAs a final matter, Judge Bacharach suggests that the Tribes have somehow waived any argument that such rules or regulations don't exist. See Op. of Bacharach, J., 11 (\"[T]he [T]ribes have not questioned the sufficiency of HUD's implementing regulations.\u201d); id. at 11 n.5 (\"The [T]ribes have argued only that HUD lacked statutory authority, not that HUD failed to properly implement that authority by adopting regulations.\u201d). But as the appellant, HUD must identify a valid basis for reversing the district court\u2019s rulings. See Nixon v. City & Cty. of Denver, 784 F.3d 1364, 1366 (10th Cir. 2015) (\"The first task of an appellant is to explain to us why the district court\u2019s decision was wrong,\u201d). As appellees, on the other hand, the Tribes have no obligation to attempt to refute a potential basis for reversal that HUD has never advanced. See Headrick v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 24 F.3d 1272, 1278 (10th Cir. 1994) (\"In preparing briefs and arguments, an appellee is entitled to rely on the content of an appellant\u2019s brief for the scope of the issues appealed .... \u201d (quoting Pignons S.A. de Mecanique v. Polaroid Corp., 701 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1983))). Contrary to Judge Ba-charach\u2019s suggestion, therefore, the Tribes simply cannot waive a response to an argument that HUD doesn\u2019t make.\n, The district court previously ordered HUD to set aside a portion of the 2008 NAHASDA appropriation for the purpose of repaying the Tribes. To the extent that (1) any of the Tribes allege that HUD wrongfully withheld 2008 NAHASDA grant funds, and (2) the 2008 funds that HUD set '\u00e1side were sufficient to cover those Tribes\u2019 2008 losses, this sovereign-immunity analysis doesn\u2019t apply. For instance, HUD concedes that the district court\u2019s order directing HUD to repay the Navajo doesn\u2019t constitute an award of money damages.\n. Judge Matheson asserts that \"we should follow Bowen,\" rather than Houston and Suffolk. Op. of Matheson, J., 11. But the issue we , confront today\u2014i.e., whether an order to pay a grant recipient from a source of funds other than the relevant fiscal year appropriation constitutes an award of money., damages\u2014 simply didn't arise in Bowen. On the contrary, it doesn\u2019t appear that the district court in Bowen ordered the federal government to transfer any funds to Massachusetts, let alone that it ordered the government to transfer those funds from a source other than the original one. See Bowen, 487 U.S. at 888, 108 S.Ct. 2722 (noting that \"judgment did not purport to state what amount of money, if any, was owed by the United, States to Massachusetts, nor did it order that any payment be made\u201d). Instead, it appears that Massachusetts may have simply remained in possession of the disputed funds all along, thus rendering it unnecessary for the district court to order their ret\u00fcrn\u2014and likewise rendering it unnecessary for the Supreme Court to address whether such an order might constitute an award of money damages. See, e.g., id. at 884 & n.3, 108 S.Ct. 2722 (noting that applicable statute allowed Massachusetts to retain disputed funds \"pending resolution of the dispute\").\n. For the reasons discussed above, see supra n.9, we affirm the district court\u2019s order directing HUD to return to the Navajo the funds it wrongfully recaptured from that tribe in 2008, but only to the extent that sufficient funds were set aside from the 2008 NAHAS-DA appropriation for that purpose.",

        "text": "MATHESON, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI join Judge Moritz\u2019s opinion except for Part II.C., which holds that, to the extent HUD no longer had the Tribes\u2019 particular funds, sovereign immunity bars the Tribes from recovering. The majority concludes that HUD enjoys sovereign immunity because the agency had allocated the money the Tribes seek and ordering HUD to pay the Tribes from any other source would constitute impermissible \u201cmoney damages.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court has explained that the nature of the relief sought, not the source of the funds, determines whether sovereign immunity applies. The Tribes are seeking specific relief\u2014enforcement of NAHASDA\u2019s mandate. They are not seeking damages, and therefore the waiver of sovereign immunity in the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, applies.\nAlthough sovereign immunity poses no bar to the Tribes\u2019 recovery, a different limitation\u2014the Appropriations Clause\u2014 may prevent them from obtaining their funds. HUD can disburse funds only according to the terms of the appropriations it receives from Congress. The district court did not determine whether HUD has appropriations available to satisfy the Tribes\u2019 entitlements under NAHASDA. I therefore agree that we should vacate the judgments, but I would remand for the district court to address the appropriations issue.\nThe- following discussion attempts to expand and support these points.\nA. Sovereign Immunity, APA \u00a7 702, Specific Relief, and \u201cMoney Damages\u201d\n\u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government' and its agencies from suit.\u201d FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). \u201c[A] waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290, 132 S.Ct. 1441, 182 L.Ed.2d 497 (2012) (quotations omitted).\nSection 702 of the APA provides such a waiver:.\nA person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof. An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States ....\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (emphasis added).\nThe Supreme Court addressed the meaning of \u00a7 702\u2019s \u201cmoney damages\u201d phrase in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988). Massachusetts claimed the federal government owed it Medicaid payments. Under Medicaid, the federal government provides financial assistance to states to provide low-income individuals with health care. See id. at 883-84, 108 S.Ct. 2722. When the federal government \u201cdisallowed\u201d\u2014i.e., refused to pay\u2014certain expenses, Massachusetts .sued for the money by asking the district court to reverse the disallowances. Id. at 886-88,108- S.Ct. 2722. The Supreme Court held Massachusetts\u2019s case fell within \u00a7 702\u2019s waiver because it \u201c[was] not a suit seeking money in compensation for the damage sustained by the failure of the Federal Government to pay as mandated; rather it [was] a suit seeking to enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happened] to be one for the payment of money.\u201d Id. at 900,108 S.Ct, 2722. The Court explained that \u00a7 702 does not bar actions that seek \u201cmonetary relief,\u201d only ones seeking \u201cmoney damages.\u201d See id. at 896-97,108 S.Ct. 2722.\n.Interpreting \u00a7 702, the-Court distinguished substitutionary relief, which compensates the plaintiff for its losses, from specific relief, which gives the plaintiff the thing to which it is entitled. See id. at 893, 108 S.Ct. 2722. For example, when a plaintiff suffers \u201can injury to his person, property, or reputation,\u201d an award of \u201cmonetary compensation,\u201d or \u201cdamages,\u201d serves to substitute for that loss. Id. By contrast, \u201cspecific relief\u2019 includes \u201can order ... for the recovery of specific property or monies, ejectment from land, or injunction either directing or restraining the defendant officer\u2019s actions.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). The Court q\u00faoted the D.C. Circuit:. \u201c\u2018Damages are given to the plaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss, whereas specific remedies \u201care not substitute remedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 895, 108 S.Ct. 2722 (quoting Md. Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Bork, J.) (in turn quoting D. Dobbs, Handbook on the Law of Remedies 135 (1973))).\nMonetary relief can be specific or substi-tutionary. Thus, \u201c[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is - not a sufficient -reason to characterize the relief as \u2018money damages.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 893,108 S.Ct. 2722. Money is often substitutionary, such as when it compensates a plaintiff for a personal injury, but the monetary relief in Bowen was specific because Massachusetts sought \u201cto enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happened] to be one for the payment of money.\u201d Id. at 900,108 S.Ct. 2722.\nIn contrast to Bowen, the Supreme Court ruled in Department of the Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 256-57, 119 S.Ct. 687, 142 L.Ed.2d 718 (1999), that sovereign immunity barred the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit because it sought substitutionary relief. Blue Fox was a subcontractor on an Army construction project. Id. The general contractor became insolvent and left the project without paying Blue Fox under the subcontract. Id. Blue Fox sued the Army in federal district court, attempting to acquire and enforce an \u201cequitable lien\u201d on the Army\u2019s remaining project funds. Id. at 258, 119 S.Ct. 687. The Supreme Court held sovereign immunity barred Blue Fox\u2019s lawsuit. Id. at 263, 119 S.Ct. 687. Bowen\u215b analysis of \u00a7 702, the Court explained, turns- on the distinction \u201cbetween specific relief and compensatory, or substitute, relief,\u201d not on whether the action is equitable or legal. Id. at 261-62, 119 S.Ct. 687. Blue Fox sought substitutionary relief because \u201cby their nature\u201d equitable liens \u201c[do] not give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled; instead [they] merely grant[ ] a plaintiff a security interest in the property, which the plaintiff can then use to satisfy a money claim.\u201d Id. at 262-63, 119 S.Ct. 687 (brackets, citation, and quotations omitted). The lien was \u201ca means' to the end of satisfying a claim for the recovery of money,\u201d and was substitute, not specific, relief. Id.\nTogether, Bowen' and Blue Fox reveal that the function of the remedy is critical to whether the action falls within \u00a7 702\u2019s waiver. In Bowen, the remedy was fulfilment of the plaintiff\u2019s statutory entitlement to federal payments under Medicaid. 487 U.S. at 900,108 S.Ct. 2722. The Bowen suit fit within \u00a7 702\u2019s waiver because it gave the plaintiff the specific thing\u2014federal Medicaid payments\u2014to which it was entitled. In Blue Fox, the plaintiff sought, through an equitable lien, \u201cmoney in the hands of the Government as compensation for the loss resulting from the default of the prime contractor.\u201d 525 U.S. at 263,119 S.Ct. 687. The Blue Fox suit was outside \u00a7 702\u2019s waiver because it did not concern the thing the plaintiff was owed\u2014payment from the general contractor\u2014and was thus substitutionary.\nIn sum, under the Supreme Court\u2019s eases, the distinction between specific and substitutionary relief turns on the nature of the relief, not on the source of funds.\nB. Application\n' This case is similar to Bowen. The Tribes seek enforcement of their entitlement to- NAHASDA funds. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4111(a)(1) (\u201c[T]he Secretary shall ... make grants under this section on behalf of Indian tribes .... \u201d). The Tribes do not allege the government destroyed or damaged their housing units or that other harms arose from the government\u2019s recapture of grant funds or failure to pay in a timely fashion. The Tribes seek only the grant funds themselves\u2014the very thing to which they are entitled. As in Bowen, the Tribes have sued as statutory beneficiaries to enforce a mandate for the payment of money by the federal government. This is not a suit' for . damages, \u00a7 702\u215b waiver applies, and sovereign immunity poses no bar.\nC. The Majority\u2019s Arguments\nThe majority does not contend this case is closer to Blue Fox than Bowen. Its analysis rests on a meaning of \u201csubstitu-tionary\u201d relief drawn from out-of-circuit cases that differs from the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent. The majority concludes the Tribes are requesting substitutionary relief because HUD has already disbursed the wrongfully recaptured funds and would now have to repay the Tribes with other moneys. I address this rationale and then discuss the two cases the majority relies on for support.\n1. Source of the funds\nThe majority contends the district court awarded substitutionary relief because HUD had disbursed the funds that should have gone to the Tribes. Maj. op. at 1196 - 97. Under this view, the source of funds to pay the Tribes matters. But using different dollars to satisfy the Tribes\u2019 specific entitlement does not make the Tribes\u2019 relief substitutionary. As discussed above, the function of the remedy determines whether it is specific or substitutionary. The Tribes are requesting specific relief\nbecause, just like in Bowen, they seek enforcement of \u201cthe statutory mandate itself, which happens to be one for the payment of money.\u201d 487 U.S. at 900, 108 S.Ct, 2722. In Bowen, Massachusetts was not asking to recover the exact same dollars the government had refused to pay it. Any dollars would do. See id. at 884 n.3, 887 nn. 8-9, 108 S.Ct. 2722 (noting it was unclear what had happened to the particular Medicaid funds).\nOther forms of tangible property\u2014the majority uses the example of a house\u2014can have unique aspects that make replacement by similar goods a close but imperfect substitute. But money is fungible, or, as the majority says, \u201cmoney is money.\u201d Maj. op. at 1196. The Tribes do not care, just as Massachusetts in Bowen did not care, which dollars they receive as long as their NAHASDA grant funds are paid to them. The majority errs in treating this dispute as though it were over rare coins. In Bowen, Justice Scalia recognized in dissent that the Court\u2019s discussion of \u201cthe very thing\u201d to which Massachusetts was entitled was money, not particular currency. See 487 U.S. at 917-19 & n.3, 108 S.Ct. 2722 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\nThe majority\u2019s house example shows why the Tribes are seeking specific, not substitutionary, relief under Bowen. The majority posits that if HUD had wrongfully given one tribe\u2019s house to another tribe, the most that the wronged tribe could recover would be the house\u2019s monetary equivalent, which would be substitute relief and \u201cmoney damages.\u201d Maj. op. at 1196 - 97. But that is not the situation we face here because money is interchangeable and houses are not. The Bowen Court discussed in-kind benefits to explain why suits for money can constitute specific relief:\nIn the present case, [the State] is seeking funds to which a statute allegedly entitles it, rather than money in compensation for the losses, whatever they may be, that [the State] will suffer or has suffered by virtue of the withholding of those funds. If the program in this case involved in-kind benefits this would be altogether evident. The fact that in the present case it is money rather than in-kind benefits that pass from the federal government to the states ... cannot transform the nature of the relief sought\u2014specific relief, not relief in the form of damages.\nBowen, 487 U.S. at 895, 108 S.Ct. 2722 (majority opinion) (emphasis added) (quoting Md. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 763 F.2d at 1446).\nWhen a plaintiff is entitled to a sum of money, receipt of money totaling that sum brings the plaintiff the very thing to which it is entitled. Fungible money does not \u201csubstitute\u201d for other money. Money is money.\n2. Circuit cases\nTo support its view that the source of the funds matters for purposes of sovereign immunity, the majority turns to two out-of-circuit cases. As detailed below, however, the results in these cases rested on mootness and the Appropriations Clause. Their discussion of \u00a7 702 and sovereign immunity is cursory and cannot be squared with Bowen.\na. City of Houston\nIn City of Houston v. HUD, 24 F.3d 1421 (D.C. Cir. 1994), HUD awarded Houston a grant of approximately $20 million out of 1986 appropriations. Id. at 1424. Four months later, HUD reduced the grant by $2.6 million and reallocated that money to other grant recipients. Id. Houston sued, but not before the congressional act appropriating the disputed money had lapsed. Id. Relying on the \u201cwell-settled\u201d constitutional principle \u201cthat when an appropriation has lapsed or has been fully obligated, federal courts cannot order the expenditure of funds that were covered by that appropriation,\u201d the D.C. Circuit held the city\u2019s claim for monetary relief was moot because the appropriation was both lapsed and fully obligated. Id.; see also id. at 1427. The court explained the mootness problem stemmed from the Appropriations Clause. See id. at 1428 (discussing Appropriations Clause); see also id. (\u201cNothing in Bowen ... even obliquely addresses the question of expired or fully obligated appropriations .... \u201d).\nAlthough the D.C. Circuit grounded its holding in the Appropriations Clause, see id. at 1424, 1427, it tacked on a paragraph responding to Houston\u2019s \u201csuggestion]\u201d that HUD could pay the city using funds other than the 1986 grant funds, id. at 1428. The court said this would \u201crun afoul\u201d of \u00a7 702 because relief can be \u201cspecific\u201d only when it is paid out of \u201ca specific res.\u201d Id. Without further explanation or legal citation, the court announced: \u201cAn award of monetary relief from any source of fund's other than the 1986 ... appropriation would constitute money damages rather than specific relief, and so would not be authorized by APA section 702.\u201d Id.\nBut whether the government has particular funds to pay a given claim is unrelated to whether the plaintiff is seeking damages. In a more recent case, the D.C. Circuit has said' that \u2018 Bowen requires courts to \u201cfocus on the nature of the relief sought, not on whether the agency still has-the. precise funds paid,\u201d and that \u201c[w]here a plaintiff seeks an award of funds to which it claims entitlement' under a statute, the plaihtiff seeks specific relief, not damages.\u201d Am.'s Cmty. Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 829 (D.C. Cir. 2000); see also id. at 830 (\u201c[The plaintiffs] claim represents specific relief within the scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, not consequential damages compensating for an. injury. That the [defendant] no longer possesses the precise funds collected is not determinative of this analysis.\u201d). The court went on to distinguish City of Houston, where \u201c[t]he principal issue ... was mootness, not the question of allowable specific relief as opposed to unavailable money damages.\u201d Id.\nb. County of Suffolk\nThe majority also relies on County of Suffolk v, Sebelius, 605 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2010). The county claimed the Department of Health and Human Services had shortchanged it in awarding grant funds for an HIV/AIDS program in fiscal years- 2007 and 2008. Id. at 137. Because those funds were exhausted, the Second Circuit held the Appropriations Clause made the case moot. Id. at 137-38. The court added, like the D.C. Circuit in City of Houston, that a plaintiff seeking to enforce a statutory mandate is limited to \u201cthe congressional appropriation that authorized the agency\u2019s challenged expenditure\u201d; otherwise the suit becomes one for damages because no other \u201cres\u201d could provide \u201cthe - specific property the plaintiff aims to recover,\u201d Id. at 141. And, again like City of Houston, the Second Circuit offered no explanation for why the source of the money matters for purposes of sovereign immunity. \u25a0'\nRelying on these cases, the majority defines \u201cthe very thing\u201d the Tribes are entitled to- as the money for the particular NAHASDA grant years at issue. See Maj. op. at 1196-97. But as discussed below, the annual appropriations point concerns whether HUD possesses properly appropriated funds to pay the Tribes, not whether the relief is specific or substitutionary. Instead of following the majority\u2019s cases,' we should follow Bowen.\nD. NAHASDA Funding\nEven if the majority is correct that the Tribes must extract their relief from a specific res to fit within \u00a7 702\u215b sovereign immunity waiver, the majority.has not explained why we should reject the Tribes\u2019 argument that NAHASDA funding generally, not particular yearly appropriations, is the relevant res. The Tribes argue that appropriations under NAHASDA are \u201cno-year\u201d funds because they can be used across years until fully expended. Aplee. Br. at 73-78. Distinguishing the time-limited appropriations in City of Houston and Comity of Suffolk, the Tribes argue that the relevant \u201cres\u201d is all NAHASDA appropriations because the funds remain available for the NAHASDA program until exhausted. Id. at 78.\n' In response, the majority cites City of Houston, where the D.C. Circuit, after holding the relevant appropriation had lapsed and was fully obligated, rejected the City\u2019s attempt to look to other funds that it claimed were \u201cno-year\u201d appropriations. Maj. op. at 1198-99; see City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1428. The Tribes, however, do not seek to recover from other funds. They wish to recover from the NA-HASDA funds themselves.\nUnder Bowen, the Tribes\u2019 suit is not: for \u201cmoney damages.\u201d Section 702 applies because they are. seeking specific \u2022 relief\u2014 enforcement of the statutory . mandate. Sovereign immunity does not bar this suit.\nWhether HUD had sufficient funds to satisfy the Tribes\u2019 claims is still an important question, but it has nothing to do with whether they are seeking \u201cmoney damages\u201d under \u00a7 702. Rather, the source-of-funds issue concerns the availability of properly appropriated funds.\nE. The Appropriations Clause\nAlthough'sovereign immunity should not block the Tribes from seeking monetary relief for wrongfully withheld or retained NAHASDA funds, the Appropriations Clause may pose a separate problem. The Constitution provides that money can be withdrawn from the Treasury pursuant only to a congressional appropriation. See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. As the Supreme Court has explained, the Appropriations Clause assures \u201cthat public funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to the individual favor \u25a0 of Government agents or the individual pleas of litigants.\u201d Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427-28, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990). When Congress appropriates funds to an agency, the text of the appropriation limits the agency\u2019s discretion to spend. See Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182, 132 S.Ct. 2181, 2194-95, 183 L.Ed.2d 186 (2012). As applied here, HUD can pay NAHASDA funds to the Tribes only to the extent Congress has authorized HUD to do so.\nThe district court resolved th\u00e9 sovereign immunity issue in the Tribes\u2019 favor and awarded \u201cfunds from all available sources.\u201d See, e.g., Aplt. Addm. at A-l (judgment for Fort Peck Housing Authority). It did not address the appropriations issue, which concerns what funds are \u201cavailable.\u201d\nThe Tribes contend HUD has never argued that the Appropriations Clause constrains its ability to pay. See Aplee. Br. at 77. But HUD, although framing its position in terms of sovereign immunity, has said it \u201cno longer has the funds\u201d from the past grant years because they \u201chave been fully obligated.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 66, 68. As discussed above, the availability of funds concerns the appropriations question, not sovereign immunity. The Tribes also contend remaining NAHASDA funds were available to satisfy their entitlement because past NAHASDA appropriations do not limit spending by year. If the Tribes are correct on that point, a dispute remains over whether there were sufficient funds to cover the Tribes\u2019 entitlements.\nI would remand for the district court to analyze these appropriations questions.\nF. Conclusion\nSection 702 has waived HUD\u2019s sovereign immunity. The Tribes are not seeking money damages because they are seeking fulfillment of a specific statutory mandate. But because the parties dispute whether Congress has appropriated funds that HUD could use to satisfy the Tribes\u2019 entitlements under NAHASDA and because the district court did not address the appropriations issue, I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to vacate the judgments. I would, however, remand for further proceedings on the appropriations issue.\n. Because Judge Bacharach joins Part II.C. of Judge Moritz's opinion regarding sovereign immunity, I will refer to it as the \"majority.\u201d\n. The Appropriations Clause provides: \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ....\u201d U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7.\n. The majority states that \"whether an order to pay a grant recipient from a source of funds other than the relevant fiscal year appropriation constitutes an award of money damages ... simply didn\u2019t arise in Bowen.\" Maj. op. at 1197 n.ll. But the cases are closer than this statement suggests. Massachusetts, similar to the Tribes here, was a recipient of a \"grant-in-aid program.\u201d Bowen, 487 U.S. at 882 n.1, 898, 908, 108 S.Ct. 2722, and both Medicaid and NAHASDA are statutory mandates for the payment of money to certain beneficiaries. The alleged disallowances in Bowen are similar to the alleged \"administrative offsetfe]\u201d here. Maj. op. at 1185-86. Apart from the differences between these funding programs, Bowen established that whether \u00a7 702 applies turns on the nature of the requested relief; the case did not hinge on a particular fiscal year appropriation. As I discuss below, the majority\u2019s appropriations concern is properly couched as an issue under the Appropriations Clause, not sovereign immunity.\n. As the majority notes, Maj. op. at 3197 n. 11, it was not clear to the Court in Bowen whether the Medicaid funds that Massachusetts claimed were in the state\u2019s or the federal government's possession; \"The record does not tell us whether the State ... elected to retain the amount in dispute.\u201d 487 U.S. at 887 n.8, 108 S.Ct. 2722. In the face of that uncertainty, the Court still held the case was \"within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 702's waiver of sovereign immunity.\u201d Id. at 910, 108 S.Ct, 2722. The Court did not limit its holding to the majority\u2019s view that only a claim to recover the precise funds taken or withheld can qualify for \u00a7 702\u2019s sovereign immunity waiver. Rather, it adopted a specific-versus-substitutionary approach to relief under \u00a7 702. We should follow the Supreme Court\u2019s approach because Bowen is binding. The majority's cases from our sibling circuits are not.\n. The majority also cites cases decided under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g).\" See Maj. op. at 1196-97. Such cases,.are inapt.\nThe rule provides: \"A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of properly or by the deprivation of property may move for the property\u2019s return.\u201d The majority cites Clymore v. United States, 415 F.3d 1113 (10th Cir. 2005), where we held, without distinguishing between cash and other property, that a-person cannot recover property under the rule if \"the government no longer possesses the property.\u201d Id. at 1120. The majority also looks to Diaz v. United States, 517 F.3d 608 (2d Cir. 2008), where the Second Circuit concluded the government enjoys sovereign immunity when it has wrongfully seized a defendant\u2019s money but also has disbursed'it because, lacking - the defendant's particular cash, the government could only pay back \"the cash equivalent.\u201d Id. at 611.\nThese cases arose under a different legal provision. Transplanting \"them to the \u00a7 702 context is unwarranted. As one scholar has observed, Rule 41(g) by its terms \"requires the existence of 'property' that is capable of return.\u201d Colleen P. Murphy, \"Money as a 'Specific' Remedy,\u201d 58 Ala. L. Rev. 119, 151 (2006). By contrast, \u00a7 702, as Bowen explained, turns on whether the relief is specific or substitutionary. See 487 U.S. at 893, 108 S.Ct. 2722; see also Murphy, supra, at 142 (explaining the Bowen \"majority construed 'damages\u2019 in section 702 of the- APA to connote substitutionary monetary relief\u201d). \u201cThus, an even stronger argument can-be made under section 702 than under Rule 41(g) that the defendant need not possess the monetary res.\" Murphy, supra, at 151.\n. The majority\u2019s year-specific approach leads it to conclude that some Tribes may be able to recover wrongfully withheld grant funds from 2008 because the district court ordered a portion of the 2008 NAHASDA funds to be set aside.

        "text": "BACHARACH, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI join the majority\u2019s excellent opinion in Parts 11(A) and (C). But in connection with Part 11(B), I respectfully dissent. In my view, HUD enjoyed statutory authority to recoup overpayments under the block grants. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion in Part 11(B) that HUD lacked this authority.\nThe Native American Housing Assis-t\u00e1nce and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (\u201cNAHASDA\u201d) authorizes a pool of funds for HUD to allocate among Native American tribes. In this ease, HUD overpaid certain tribes and sought to recoup the overpayments through administrative offset.\nThe tribes contend that HUD lacked authority to recoup the overpayments. According to the tribes, agencies like HUD can exercise authority only upon a delegation from Congress. See La. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374, 106 S.Ct. 1890, 90 L.Ed.2d 369 (1986). The tribes acknowledge that \u201cCongress empowered HUD to administratively recapture grant funds.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Resp. Br. at 19. The tribes argue, however, that this statutory power is limited to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4161 and 4165. And, as the majority explains, these provisions do not apply here.\nHUD argues that it obtained authority to recoup the overpayments through NA-HASDA, which implicitly incorporated the longstanding common-law principle that governmental entities can recoup erroneous payments. I agree with HUD, Through NAHASDA, Congress incorporated common-law principles that allowed HUD to recoup the overpayments by adjusting the tribes\u2019 annual allocations. Because the majority reaches a different conclusion, I respectfully dissent with regard to Part 11(B) of the majority opinion.\nI. There is a longstanding common-law principle that governmental entities can recoup overpayments by offsetting amounts otherwise owed to the recipients.\nIn justifying the administrative offsets here, HUD relies on the common-law principle that governmental entities may recoup erroneous payments. Appellants\u2019 Opening Br. at 44 (citing United States v. Wurts, 303 U.S. 414, 415, 58 S.Ct. 637, 82 L.Ed. 932 (1938)). The Supreme Court recognized this principle in United States v. Wurts, stating that the government can recoup overpayments through \u201cappropriate action.\u201d 303 U.S. at 415, 58 S.Ct. 637.\nAs the tribes point out, Wurts involved a suit by the government to recoup its funds. See id. at 415-16, 58 S.Ct. 637 (noting that the government has a \u201clong-established right to sue for money 'wrongfully or erroneously paid from the public treasury\u201d). Thus, the tribes would limit the Wurts principle to situations involving suit brought by the federal government. See Appellees\u2019 Resp. Br. at 48 (arguing that the Wurts principle stands only for the proposition that the government may \u201cbring a civil common law action in an Article III court to recover funds that were paid by \u2018mistake,\u2019 through the common law cause of \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019\u201d).\nThe majority agrees with the tribes\u2019 interpretation of Wurts, concluding that the Wurts principle allows the government only \u201cto sue to collect overpayments.\u201d See Maj. Op. at 1192-93 (emphasis in majority opinion). The majority recognizes that in Grand Trunk Western Railway Co. v. United States, 252 U.S. 112, 117, 40 S.Ct. 309, 64 L.Ed. 484 (1920), and United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 236, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947), the Supreme Court allowed the recoupment of overpayments even without a suit. See Maj. Op. at 1193-94. But, the majority attempts to distinguish Grand Trunk and Munsey Trust based on the fact that they involved governmental contracts with private parties, not administrative offsets, and did not involve a \u201cunique trust responsibility.\u201d Id. at 1193-94.\nI respectfully disagree. Wurts did not have occasion to address the availability of common-law authority to recoup overpay-ments in the absence of suit. Thus, Wurts cannot be read as a limitation on this authority. See Alwert v. Cox Comm\u2019ns, Inc., 835 F.3d 1195, 1212 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cAn opinion is not binding precedent on an issue not addressed in the opinion.\u201d); see also Maj. Op. at 1191 (\u201c\u2018Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S.Ct. 148, 69 L.Ed. 411 (1925))). Indeed, Wurts relied on prior Supreme Court opinions stating that the government\u2019s common-law authority may come from either a suit or an offset. Wurts, 303 U.S. at 415 n.3, 416 n.4, 58 S.Ct. 637 (citing Supreme Court opinions). And five federal appellate courts have interpreted Wurts to allow offset without the need for suit. Until now, no circuit court\nhas required the government to sue when invoking the common-law authority to recoup overpayments.\nThe majority appears to recognize that suit is unnecessary when the government exercises its common-law authority to recoup overpayments from contractors. But a governmental contract is simply one of many situations in which the common law has recognized a right of offset without the need for a suit:\nThe right of setoff is \u201cinherent in the United States Government,\u201d and exists independent of any statutory grant of authority to the executive branch. The scope of this common law right is broad. Historically, it has been exercised against anyone who has a \u201cclaim\u201d against the government, including unpaid government contractors,., persons to whom the government owes retirement benefits, and employees to whom final salary payments or lump sum, payments are due.\nUnited States v. Tafoya, 803 F.2d 140,141-42- (5th Cir. 1986) (citations omitted). Thus, four , federal appellate courts have applied Wurts to allow administrative offsets even without the need for suit or the applicability of a government contract. See Bechtel, 781 F.2d at 906-07; Collins, 661 F.2d at 708; Wilson Clinic & Hosp., Inc., 494 F.2d at 51-52; DiSilvestro, 405 F.2d at \u00cd53, 155. .\nAs the majority points out, these opinions do not involve a \u201cunique [trust] relationship.\u201d Maj. Op. at 1194. But the majority does not\n\u2022 explain why this difference creates a material distinction or\n\u2022 address the long line of authority allowing administrative offsets without the need for court action.\nThe majority points out that the government serves as a trustee for the tribes that are overpaid. - But overpayments diminish the amounts available to other tribes, who are also beneficiaries of this trust relationship. The majority does not explain why the. government\u2019s role as trustee would affect the widely recognized power to recoup overpayments.\nThe majority relies on an excerpt from a treatise by Richard Cappalli, Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements: Law, Policy, and Practice. This excerpt discusses authorization to recoup funds otherwise owed to the governmental entity making the grant. Richard B. Cappalli, Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements: Law,. Policy, and Practice \u00a7 8:15, at 81 (1991 Cum. Supp.). But in the cited excerpt, Mr, Cappalli makes clear that even when trust relationships are involved, Congress implicitly delegates the power to administratively enforce grant programs notwithstanding the absence of an express statutory remedy: \u25a0\nAlthough Congress has occasionally provided in express terms for the recovery of federal paym\u00e9nts through deductions from subsequent payments or lawsuits, the existence of such authorizations should not be taken as evidence that Congress intended no recoveries in programs lacking them. It is equally probable that Congress was doing'no more than making explicit an administrative enforcement right otherwise implicitly held. The correct analysis is that the statutory duty of federal agencies to administer assistance is necessarily .accompanied by the power to enforce conditions of aid through reasonable means.\nId. Mr. Cappalli\u2019s treatise does not suggest that a suit is needed when a governmental trustee seeks to offset funds that are otherwise owed, and the majority does not provide any other authority or reason to require suit when a governmental trustee seeks to recoup overpayments.\nII. NAHASDA authorizes HUD to recoup mistakenly distributed funds.\nCongress implicitly delegated this common-law authority to HUD, authorizing it to recoup overpayments through offset. Indeed, in the absence of such a delegation, Congress would have left a gaping hole in NAHASDA by requiring HUD to allocate funds from a finite sum without any power to correct errors, leaving some tribes with too much and other tribes with too little.\nIn enacting NAHASDA, Congress presumably retained the common-law authority to recoup overpayments. See United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 L.Ed.2d 245 (1993)\n(\u201c \u2018[Statutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783, 72 S.Ct. 1011, 96 L.Ed. 1294 (1952) (ellipsis in original))). Thus, Congress\u2019s silence on HUD\u2019s ability to recoup overpayments indicates an intent to adopt the common-law principle recognized in Wurts:\nCongress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles. Thus, where a common-law - principle is well established, ... the courts-may take it as given that Congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle' will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident. -\nAstoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991) (internal quotation marks & citation omitted); see Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 50:1, at 143 (7th ed. 2012) (\u201cAll legislation is interpret-\u00e9d in the light of the common law and the scheme of jurisprudence existing at the time of its enactment.\u201d).\nIf Congress had not intended to delegate this common-law power to HUD, a gap in NAHASDA would have allowed misallocations without any expressly created mechanism for correction. In my view, however, the mechanism for correction would have been implied.\n\u201c[I]t is a fundamental principle of administrative law that the powers of an administrative agency are not limited to thos\u00e9 expressly granted by the statutes, but include, also, all of the powers that may fairly be implied therefrom.\u201d Morrow v. Clayton, 326 F.2d 36, 43-44 (10th Cir. 1963); see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\u201cSometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.\u201d). Through NA-HASDA, Congress presumably delegated to HUD the powers fairly implied by the authorization to distribute funds among eligible tribes. These powers included authority to fill the gaps implicitly or explicitly created under NAHASDA:\nThe power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created and funded program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress. In the area of Indian affairs, the Executive has long been empowered to promulgate rules and policies, and the power has been given explicitly to the Secretary and his delegates at the BIA.\nMorton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Congress not only vested HUD with broad authority to administer NAHASDA, but also specifically authorized HUD to determine how much money each tribe would obtain. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4111(a); see Kaw Nation v. Springer, 341 F.3d 1186, 1187 (10th Cir. 2003) (stating that block grants under NA-HASDA are controlled by HUD).\nIf we assume that NAHASDA had not implicitly incorporated the common-law right of offset, NAHASDA\u2019s express delegation of authority would have contained a sizeable gap. This gap would unleash a Pandora\u2019s Box of problems if either HUD or a tribe made a mistake leading to a tribe\u2019s underpayment or overpayment. For example, suppose that'\n\u2022 the Navajo Tribe accurately reports the number of eligible rent-to-own units and\n\u2022 this report leads to an allocation of $100,000 for a given year.\nNow, suppose that HUD accidentally adds a zero and sends the Navajo Tribe a check for $1,000,000 instead of $100,000. Or, suppose that the Navajo Tribe accidentally miscounts its eligible housing units, inadvertently increasing the tribe\u2019s annual allocation from $100,000 to $1,000,000. In either event, what would happen? Left uncorrected, the Navajo Tribe would obtain a windfall of $900,000 and this windfall would leave HUD $900,000 short when allocating the remaining funds among other tribes.\nThis would have resulted in a gap that had not been expressly addressed in NA-HASDA. Presumably, Congress would not intend to allow such a mistake to go uncorrected. This presumption suggests that Congress implicitly delegated to HUD the authority to fill this statutory gap and correct misallocations based on mistakes by HUD or a given tribe. See Fla. Med. Ctr. of Clearwater, Inc. v. Sebelius, 614 F.3d 1276, 1281 (11th Cir. 2010) (stating that \u201cCongress implicitly delegated common law authority\u201d to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recoup overpayments from Medicare Part B providers); McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 373, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe wide open spaces in statutes such as these are most appropriately interpreted as implicit delegations of authority to the courts to fill in the gaps in the common-law tradition of case-by-case adjudication.\u201d); see also Martin H. Redish & Christopher R. Pudelski, Legislative Deception, Separation of Poivers, and the Democratic Process: Harnessing the Political Theory of United States v. Klein, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 437, 439 (2006) (stating that Congress sometimes delegates \u201ccommon-law-making power\u201d to \u201cagencies empowered to administer the statute\u201d).\nThe majority implies that this power to fill gaps would require HUD to adopt regulations when filling statutory gaps. But the tribes have not questioned the sufficiency of HUD\u2019s implementing regulations.\n\u215c * \u215c\nIn summary, HUD has the authority to recoup the overpayments. This authority stems from the common-law principle allowing offset of overpayments. Without incorporation of this common-law principle, NAHASDA would have contained a wide gap. Even then, Congress woqld have intended for HUD to fill that gap.\nThe majority reaches a different conclusion based on factual differences between our case and some of the opinions cited by HUD. But even if those opinions are distinguishable, many others support HUD\u2019s reliance on the common-law principle allowing governmental entities to recoup overpayments through administrative offset. I would apply those opinions rather than stop the analysis based on factual distinctions with HUD\u2019s cited cases. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part 11(B) of the majority opinion.\n. Grand Trunk W. R.R. Co. v. United States, 252 U.S. 112, 121, 40 S.Ct. 309, 64 L.Ed. 484 (1920) (\"[The government] was under no obligation to establish the illegality by suit.... [The government] was at liberty to deduct the amount of the overpayment from the monies otherwise payable to the company to which the overpayment had been made.\u201d); Wis. Cent. R.R. Co. v. United States, 164 U.S. 190, 211, 17 S.Ct. 45, 41 L.Ed. 399 (1896) (\"If, in [the government\u2019s] judgment, money had been paid without authority of law, and [the government] has money of the recipient in [its] hands, [it] is not compelled to pay such money over, and sue to recover the illegal payments, but may hold it subject to the decision of the court when the claimant sues. And in that way multiplicity of suits and circuity of action are avoided.\u201d (citations omitted)).\n. See Bechtel v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 781 F.2d 906, 906-07 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (holding that an agency could \"adjust[ ] the levels of ongoing payments\u201d to recoup overpayments because the Wurts principle indisputably authorized the agency to recoup funds); Collins v. Donovan, 661 F.2d 705, 708 (8th Cir. 1981) (holding that- an agency .could recoup erroneous overpay-ments under Wurts and that a regulation: allowing for this recoupment \"merely. codifies the government\u2019s common law right to recover overpayments\"); Mount Sinai Hosp. of Greater Miami, Inc. v. Weinberger, 517 F.2d 329, 337 & n.10 (5th Cir. 1975) (\"In some circumstances when government funds are improperly paid out the government has a claim enforceable either by direct suit or by setoff ...(emphasis added) (citing Wurts)), Wilson Clinic & Hosp., Inc. v. Blue Cross of S.C., 494 F.2d 50, 51-52 (4th Cir. 1974) (noting that an agency could \"withh[o]ld the amount, of alleged overpayments from later accruals\u201d because. \"[i]t is underwritten by United States v. Wurts ... that the Government may offset overpayments against current or-subsequent obligations\u201d); DiSilvestro v. United States, 405 F.2d 150, 153, 155 (2d Cir. 1968) (noting that an- agency could \"effect a-set-off\u201d to recoup erroneous payments because Wurts permits either setoff or a separate action). -\n. This argument first appeared in HUD\u2019s reply brief, and we often decline to consider arguments newly raised in a reply brief. See Stump v. Gates, 211 F.3d 527, 533 (10th Cir. 2000). But HUD was responding to the tribes' argument that Wurts did not apply to an agency's effort to recoup overpayments. HUD\u2019s reply brief was a perfectly appropriate place to respond to the tribes\u2019 argument. See Beaudry v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 331 F.3d 1164, 1166 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003) (stating that-we review issues; newly - raised in a reply brief when offered in response to an argument presented in the appellee's brief); Sadeghi v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 40 F.3d 1139, 1143 (10th Cir. 1994) (considering an argument newly raised in a reply brief because it was responding to a contention in the appel-lee\u2019s brief).\n.. HUD did not make this argument. I discuss this scenario only to show what would have transpired if Congress had failed to delegate its common-law authority to recoup overpay-ments. See note 5, below.\n. The majority states that I regard the tribes as waiving this argument. Maj. Op. at 1194\u2014 95 n.9. I am not doing that. I am simply addressing the argument that the tribes made. The tribes argued that HUD lacked any statutory authority to recoup the overpayments. That is incorrect, for Congress delegated to HUD the common-law authority to offset funds owed to the government. I have simply pointed out that in the absence of that delegation of authority, NAHASDA would have contained a gap to be filled by HUD. The tribes have argued only that HUD lacked statutory authority, not that H\u00daD failed to properly implement that authority by adopting regulations. See note 4, above.",
