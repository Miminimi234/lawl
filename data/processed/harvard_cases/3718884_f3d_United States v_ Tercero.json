        "text": "OPINION\nD.W. NELSON, Senior Circuit Judge:\nTeniah Tercero (\u201cTercero\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s decision granting in part and denying in part her motion to reduce her sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) following the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\nI. Background\nTercero\u2019s appeal concerns the retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act and the related amended Sentencing Guidelines ranges for offenses involving crack cocaine. See Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372; U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amends. 748, 750 (2010).\nThe government indicted Tercero on two counts: conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine. Tercero pled guilty to a single count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, as alleged in the information, in exchange for the dismissal of the charges in the indictment. The parties stipulated that, for the purposes of sentencing, Tercero possessed 115.8 grams of crack cocaine and 4.36 grams of methamphetamine, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 25. The parties agreed, however, that Tercero could argue for a sentence as low as 72 months. Tercero agreed to waive \u201cany right ... to appeal any aspect of [her] sentence,\u201d as well as any right to file any collateral attack on her conviction or sentence, such as by filing motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582.\nThe district court found that the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range was 84 to 105 months based on a criminal history category of 4 and a total offense level of 25. The court then considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), finding that Tercero played a minor role in the conspiracy. While Tercero knew that she was committing a serious offense, she neither created nor organized it, thus, the district court concluded that her minor role made \u201cher conduct less serious than a mechanical application of the guidelines would suggest.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that a downward departure was appropriate and imposed a sentence of 72 months with a three-year term of supervised release.\nThereafter, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, (\u201cFSA\u201d), and the Sentencing Commission amended the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. Tercero then filed a \u00a7 3582 motion to reduce her sentence to 58 months, or 12 months below the recalculated Guidelines range. The district court found that Amendment 750 to the Guidelines warranted a reduction in Tercero\u2019s sentence from 72 to 70 months, based on adjusted offense level 24 and a resulting adjusted Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. The district court concluded, however, that it did not have the authority to depart below 70 months in resentencing Tercero because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) prohibits reductions below the low end of the adjusted Guidelines range. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the district court correctly interpreted and applied both \u00a7 3582(c) and \u00a7 1B1.10.\nII. Standard of Review\nWe review de novo whether Tercero has waived her right to appeal her plea agreement. See United States v. Speelman, 431 F.3d 1226, 1229 (9th Cir.2005). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). United States v. Lightfoot, 626 F.3d 1092, 1094 (9th Cir.2010). \u201cA district court may abuse its discretion if it does not apply the correct law or if it rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of material fact.\u201d United States v. Chaney, 581 F.3d 1123, 1125 (9th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nIII. Discussion\nA. Waiver\nTercero did not waive her right to appeal the reduced sentence. Although she did \u201cagree to waive any right ... to appeal any aspect of [her] sentence, including any orders relating to forfeiture and/or restitution,\u201d we have held that such a broad waiver does not encompass the right to appeal a \u00a7 3582(c) decision. Lightfoot, 626 F.3d at 1095. Moreover, although Tercero expressly waived her right to bring a \u00a7 3582 motion in her plea agreement, the government did not- argue at the resentencing hearing that Tercero had waived this right. Thus, the government cannot rely on this provision to argue that Tercero\u2019s appeal is not properly before us. See Norwood v. Vance, 591 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cIt is well-established that a party can waive waiver implicitly by failing to assert it.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nB. District Court Authority to Reduce Sentence\nCongress passed the FSA to \u201crestore fairness to Federal cocaine sentencing\u201d by changing the threshold quantities of crack cocaine that trigger mandatory minimum sentences. Pub.L. 111-220, \u00a7 2, 124 Stat. 2372, 2372 (2010). Congress gave the Sentencing Commission the authority to amend the Guidelines to implement the FSA. Id. \u00a7 8. The Commission thereafter promulgated Amendment 750 to reduce the Guidelines\u2019 crack-related offense levels and made the amendment retroactive. U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 750, 759.\nFollowing the amendments to the Guidelines, the Commission also revised policy statement \u00a7 1B1.10. The previous version of \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) permitted prisoners who had received below-Guidelines sentences to obtain reductions below the amended ranges in proportion to the downward departures imposed at their original sentencing. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (2010). Because this rule proved difficult to administer and prompted litigation, the Commission revised \u00a7 1B1.10 following enactment of the FSA to prohibit courts from reducing a \u201cdefendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (2011); see Notice of Final Action Regarding Amendment to Policy Statement 1B1.10, 76 Fed.Reg. 41332, 41334 (July 13, 2011).\nIn determining whether the district court erred, we look first to the relevant statute: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 3582 authorizes district courts to reduce a sentence retroactively when the Commission has subsequently lowered the Sentencing range. In \u00a7 3582, Congress specifically required that any sentence reductions be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Id. Under the plain language of this statute, then, the district court was required to apply \u00a7 1B1.10, and the district court concluded correctly that under the revised version of \u00a7 1B1.10, it could not adjust Tercero\u2019s sentence below 70 months.\nTercero argues that the revised version of \u00a7 1B1.10 is at odds with the plain language of the FSA and is therefore invalid. But Tercero has not identified any specific provision in the FSA with which \u00a7 1B1.10 conflicts. ' To the contrary, we are mindful that the Commission has the express authority to promulgate policy statements regarding the retroactivity of amendments to the Guidelines. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(x).\nTercero also relies on United States v. LaBonte in support of her argument that \u00a7 1B1.10 conflicts with the FSA. 520 U.S. 751, 757, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997). In that case, the Supreme Court invalidated Amendment 506 as in direct conflict with the language of the Sentencing Reform Act. Id. at 756-57, 117 S.Ct. 1673. The Commission had promulgated Amendment 506 to define the phrase \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d in furtherance of Congress\u2019s directive to \u201cassure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h). The amendment defined \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d to preclude the consideration of statutory enhancements. LaBonte, 520 U.S. at 756-57, 117 S.Ct. 1673. The Supreme Court held that Amendment 506 was at odds with the plain language of \u00a7 994(h) because the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the phrase \u201cmaximum term authorized,\u201d is \u201cthe \u2018highest\u2019 or \u2018greatest\u2019 sentence allowed by statute,\u201d not the unenhanced maximum. Id. at 757-58, 117 S.Ct. 1673 (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 979 (6th ed.1990)).\nBut Tercero does not argue that the revised version of \u00a7 IB 1.10 conflicts with the text of the FSA. Instead, she contends that \u00a7 1B1.10 contradicts Congress\u2019s general intent in passing the FSA, which was \u201cto restore fairness to Federal cocaine sentencing.\u201d Pub.L. 111-220, \u00a7 2, 124 Stat. 2372, 2372. The most specific provision that Tercero identifies is \u00a7 8 of the Act, which instructs the Commission to promulgate all Guidelines, amendments and policy statements provided for in the Act. See id. \u00a7 8. That broad instruction, however, does not resemble the kind of specific language that required invalidation of Amendment 506 in LaBonte. Moreover, the FSA does not contain any specific language indicating how \u2014 or even whether \u2014 the Act should be applied retroactively. See generally id. In fact, we have held that the FSA does not apply retroactively to adjust the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses. United States v. Augustine, 712 F.3d 1290, 1291 (9th Cir.2013). Thus, we remain unpersuaded that Congress intended the FSA to implement the retroactive reduction of sentencing ranges in any particular way, much less one that conflicts with \u00a7 1B1.10 as revised.\nTercero urges us to conclude that we need not comply with \u00a7 1B1.10, as the Supreme Court held we must in Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2687, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Tercero argues that Dillon is of questionable validity because it considered an earlier version of \u00a7 1B1.10. We disagree that Dillon is distinguishable from the case before us. While Tercero is correct that Dillon considered a different version of \u00a7 1B1.10, the substance of the policy statement was not the animating factor that caused the Court to hold that \u00a7 1B1.10 is binding on courts. Instead, Dillon reiterated that a court must follow two steps in considering a motion to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2): First, a court must determine if a reduction is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, and, then, a court must consider whether a reduction is authorized in whole or in part, according to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Dillon, 130 S.Ct. at 2691. This analysis did not hinge to any degree on the substantive content of \u00a7 1B1.10. Thus, the amendment of that policy statement does not affect this two-step process. As discussed, the district court correctly followed this procedure. The court first determined that a reduction below 70 months would be inconsistent with \u00a7 1B1.10 as revised and therefore declined to grant Tercero\u2019s motion in full.\nNor does \u00a7 1B1.10 conflict -with the purpose of the Guidelines, as Tercero argues. She notes that the Guidelines were meant to bring about \u201can effective, fair sentencing system,\u201d with honest, uniform and proportionate sentences. Tercero contends that \u00a7 1B1.10 prevents the district court from revising her sentence to reflect the very minor role she played in the drug conspiracy. It is not in dispute, however, that when the district court originally sentenced Tercero, it did consider the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). A motion brought under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding. Instead, it provides for the \u2018modification of] a term of imprisonment\u2019 by giving courts the power to \u2018reduce\u2019 an otherwise final sentence in circumstances specified by the Commission.\u201d Dillon, 130 S.Ct. at 2690. \u201cSection 3582(c)(2)\u2019s text, together with its narrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.\u201d Id. at 2691. The procedural posture of this case makes it inappropriate for us to reweigh the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) to assess the fairness of Tercero\u2019s 70-month sentence.\nTercero also argues that revised \u00a7 1B1.10 conflicts with the statute that authorized the Commission to apply amendments retroactively. But Congress has given the Commission a \u201csubstantial role ... with respect to sentence-modification proceedings.\u201d Dillon, 130 S.Ct. at 2691. The Sentencing Reform Act \u201ccharges the Commission both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines, and with determining whether and to what extent an amendment will be retroactive.\u201d Id.; see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u). Congress also has given the Commission the power to issue policy statements to address, among other things, \u201cthe appropriate use of ... the sentence modification provisions set forth in\u201d \u00a7 3582(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(2)(C). So rather than conflicting with congressional intent, as Terce-ro argues, the revisions to \u00a7 1B1.10 fall squarely within the scope of Congress\u2019s articulated role for the Commission.\nFinally, we reject Tercero\u2019s claim that revised \u00a7 1B1.10 is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). The Commission is not an agency subject to the requirements of the APA but \u201can independent entity in the judicial branch.\u201d Wash. Legal Found, v. U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 17 F.3d 1446, 1450 (D.C.Cir.1994); see also United States v. Berberena, 694 F.3d 514, 526-27 (3d Cir.2012) (holding \u201cthe Commission is not required to abide by the APA\u2019s notice- and-comment provisions when issuing policy statements\u201d). Although Congress does require the Commission to hold public hearings in promulgating the Guidelines, this mandate does not extend to policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(1), (a)(2) & (x); see Andrade v. U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 989 F.2d 308, 309 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam). Thus, to the extent Tercero relies on cases in which we have reviewed agency decisions under the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard, those cases do not apply to the Commission\u2019s promulgation of \u00a7 1B1.10.\nAFFIRMED.\n. Section IB 1.10 carves out an exception to this prohibition for defendants who provide \"substantial assistance to authorities.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B). This exception does not apply to Tercero.",
