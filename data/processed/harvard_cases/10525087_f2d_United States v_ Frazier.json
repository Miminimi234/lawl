        "text": "EDMONDSON, Circuit Judge:\nBobbie Ray Frazier appeals her conviction on two counts of making false statements before a grand jury. We affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nFrazier had since 1981 been a clerical employee of Royal Buick, Inc. (Royal Buick), which was one of the largest automobile dealerships in the Tampa, Florida area. During 1985 and 1986, Royal Buick commenced a massive scheme to defraud a federally insured bank. Briefly stated, sales personnel, through a series of ploys, would induce credit-poor customers to purchase used cars by offering substantial rebates, which were in fact the difference between the normal selling price and a purchase price inflated by the amount of the rebate. The sales personnel would later falsify credit applications to make these credit-poor customers appear creditworthy. Customer \u201crebates\u201d would then be paid out of the loan proceeds.\nA criminal investigation into this scheme began in 1987 and resulted in two indictments; eight salesmen were indicted in December 1988, and twenty-two salesmen and managers were indicted in January 1990. In December 1990, the investigation continued, with Ralph Ghioto, the owner of Royal Buick, being one of the targets of the investigation.\nThe government, as part of the investigation, subpoenaed Frazier to appear before a federal grand jury in October and November 1989. Government investigators had been informed by David Wilkerson, a former Royal Buick employee, that Frazier told him she knew about the fraud and that Ghioto may have known about the fraud as well. Wilkerson testified at trial that Frazier told him, \u201cMr. Ghioto had said that if she valued her job, she should keep her mouth shut and not ask any more questions\u201d about the fraudulent scheme. Jack Christie, another former employee, told the government that Frazier had told him about a conversation she had concerning the fraudulent scheme. Christie testified that, although he could not remember her exact words, Frazier told him that she had spoken with Ghioto about the fraud, but that Ghioto had \u201ccut her off.\u201d\nThe government brought charges based upon five responses to grand jury inquiries in which Frazier denied ever having had conversations with Christie and Wilkerson. A two-count indictment was returned, charging Frazier with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a) by making false declarations in her October and November appearances before the grand jury.\nDuring her initial grand jury appearance in October, Frazier had no attorney; but at her November appearance she retained Howard O\u2019Leary of the Dykema Gossett law firm. Royal Buick paid Dykema Gos-sett\u2019s legal fees. Dykema Gossett also represented Royal Buick and Ghioto in civil matters and in certain portions of the grand jury investigation. The government moved to disqualify O\u2019Leary at trial based on an alleged conflict of interest between Dykema Gossett\u2019s representation of Royal Buick and Ghioto and its representation of Frazier. Defense counsel claimed, however, that Royal Buick and Ghioto were exclusively represented in the criminal matter by a different law firm. Based on this information and Frazier\u2019s written waiver after receiving a detailed conflict letter, the trial judge denied the government\u2019s motion to disqualify.\nThe issue of Frazier\u2019s legal representation came up again during the trial. The prosecutor first used Royal Buick\u2019s payment of Frazier\u2019s legal expenses to help establish Frazier\u2019s motive for making false statements. Later, both Frazier\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor used Frazier\u2019s legal representation in their closing arguments, during which the prosecutor argued on rebuttal that Frazier's attorney was present at her second grand jury appearance because of cooperation among Frazier, Ghioto and O\u2019Leary.\nFrazier\u2019s theory of defense was that her medical and emotional condition (including a radical mastectomy, transient ischemic attacks, and the death of three close family members) had impaired her to the point that she had no memory of the contested conversations. She did not directly deny at trial that the conversations occurred or that her answers to the grand jury were objectively false. She claimed only that her failed memory made it impossible for her to have the knowledge required to be found guilty.\nAfter a two-day trial, Frazier was found guilty on both counts. Because of her poor financial condition, no fine was imposed; but she was sentenced to thirteen months in prison. This appeal followed.\nDISCUSSION\nAfter reviewing the many issues Frazier raises on appeal, we conclude that none warrants reversal of her conviction. We address, however, Frazier\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to explain the prohibition on reference to defense counsel set out in United States v. McDonald, 620 F.2d 559 (5th Cir.1980).\nFrazier claims on appeal that she was deprived of her constitutional rights to counsel and to a fair trial. She contends that the government prosecutors\u2019 attempts at trial to inquire about her legal representation were directed toward suggesting \u201cthat [she] was probably guilty because she accepted representation provided by her employer, and also that her attorney was acting unethically or illegally by serving as a conduit between Royal Buick and the grand jury and was controlling or shaping Mrs. Frazier\u2019s testimony to aid Royal Buick and Ralph Ghioto.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 33. We disagree, even if we were to accept that the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s remark [during rebuttal argument] falls somewhat short of the high level of evenhandedness expected of those responsible for prosecutions in IJnited States courts.\u201d United States v. Mack, 643 F.2d 1119, 1124 (5th Cir. Unit A April 1981).\nBecause Frazier\u2019s attorney failed to object to the prosecutors\u2019 allegedly improper comments during opening and closing arguments, thereby possibly precluding appellate review, we must determine whether the prosecutors\u2019 comments amounted to \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Before doing so, though, we will discuss Frazier\u2019s contention on appeal that the district court erred in allowing prosecutors to establish motive to lie by eliciting testimony on who paid her legal fees. We will then discuss the plain-error question.\nMotive Evidence\nFrazier contends that the district court erred in allowing the prosecutor to use Royal Buick\u2019s payment of her legal fees as a means of establishing motive. We disagree. In examining the district court\u2019s admission of motive evidence, we are guided by the abuse-of-discretion standard. United States v. Elkins, 885 F.2d 775, 784 (11th Cir.1989). We stated in Elkins that we view evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial effect.\u201d Id. Viewed in this light, the information about who paid Frazier\u2019s legal expenses was properly admitted into evidence. Although salary and medical insurance showed strong motives for why Frazier might have lied, that Royal Buick paid her legal expenses was properly placed before the jury to further prove the strength of her connection to Ghioto and Royal Buick.\nWe reject Frazier\u2019s argument that, because she would likely have been entitled to court-appointed counsel, the prosecutors should have been prevented from using Royal Buick\u2019s payment of her legal fees at trial because it was not probative of motive. That Frazier would have received court-appointed counsel does not remove the probative value of the evidence that Royal Buick paid for her legal expenses. The jury could reasonably infer from this evidence that Frazier had a motive to lie.\nWe also reject Frazier\u2019s reliance on United States v. McDonald, 620 F.2d 559 (5th Cir.1980). Frazier contends that McDonald stands for, among other things, the proposition that a defendant\u2019s exercise of her right to counsel may not be used as evidence of motive without infringing on her constitutional rights. McDonald, however, stands for nothing like that. It does not hold that defense lawyers are immunized from being spoken about during criminal trials. The Fifth Circuit in McDonald held only that a prosecutor\u2014to attempt to cause the jury to infer that the defendant is guilty\u2014cannot present evidence of the simple fact that defendant retained a lawyer before the defendant\u2019s arrest. Id. at 564. Here, the prosecutor was not attempting to cause the jury to infer that Frazier was guilty just because she hired an attorney. The significance of the presence of counsel was more focused and pertinent. The prosecutor was stating directly that, because Frazier was completely dependent on Royal Buick for all her financial, medical and legal needs, she had a substantial motive for lying to the grand jury to protect her benefactor. Nothing in McDonald disallows the use of such motive evidence. We conclude that Frazier\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the admission of motive evidence about who paid her legal fees.\nProsecutor\u2019s Opening Statement and Closing Arguments\nEven if we determined that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks might have been some kind of error, we would have to determine them to be \u201cplain error\u201d before we could act upon them because defense counsel failed to raise timely objections. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). The Supreme Court has instructed us that plain errors are \u201cthose errors that \u2018seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings[.]\u2019 \u201d United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 14, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (citations omitted). The plain-error doctrine, however, \u201cis to be \u2018used sparingly, solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u2019 \u201d Id. (citations omitted). As the Court has stated on more than one occasion:\n[C]ounsel for the defendant cannot as a rule remain silent, interpose no objections, and after a verdict has been returned seize for the first time on the point that [the prosecutor\u2019s] comments to the jury were improper and prejudicial.\nId. at 14 n. 13, 105 S.Ct. at 1046 n. 13 (citing United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 851, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940)). After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments failed to rise to the level of plain error.\nFrazier contends that the prosecutors first used her legal representation to infer guilt in opening statements. A reading of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement reveals that the prosecutor did, as Frazier contends he did, say that Frazier \u201cfollowed her marching orders in the Grand Jury.\u201d In context, however, the \u201cmarching orders\u201d were not a directive from her lawyers, but were Ghioto\u2019s alleged threat to fire Frazier if she spoke about the fraud. But, even if the \u201cmarching orders\u201d remark did relate to Frazier\u2019s lawyers, we see no plain error for the reasons we discuss next.\nFrazier\u2019s chief contention, though, is that the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper comments about her legal representation \u201creached a crescendo\u201d during the prosecutor\u2019s closing rebuttal argument. To analyze the prosecutor\u2019s remark properly for plain error, we must evaluate it against the entire record, Young, 470 U.S. at 14, 105 S.Ct. at 1046, and, especially here, \u201cin light of the defense argument that preceded it.\u201d Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 179, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2470, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). Frazier\u2019s attorney tried to persuade the jury to believe that the grand jury proceedings were totally secret and that neither Ghioto, O\u2019Leary nor anybody else could probably find out about Frazier\u2019s grand jury testimony. See supra note 5. This argument invited the prosecutor\u2019s rebutting argument that Frazier, who is not bound to keep the grand jury proceedings secret, could tell anybody what happened. The question arises, though, whether the prosecutor\u2019s next statement (\u201cShe told her lawyers, and her lawyers told Mr. Ghioto. You can infer that.\u201d See supra note 5.) constitutes plain error. We conclude that it does not.\nThe prosecutor was responding to the \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s opening salvo,\u201d Young, 470 U.S. at 12, 105 S.Ct. at 1045, by making the jury aware that Frazier could very easily pierce the veil of secrecy surrounding the grand jury. And while the prosecutor\u2019s comments about O\u2019Leary passing information to Ghioto might \u2014 and we stress might \u2014 have been inappropriate, they did not \u201cundermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at 16, 105 S.Ct. at 1047.\nEven if we had lingering doubts about whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments unfairly prejudiced Frazier\u2019s case \u2014 which we do not \u2014 these doubts would be quickly dissolved by the overwhelming evidence against Frazier. The government presented witnesses who testified to conversations they had with Frazier, conversations which she later denied at her grand jury appearance. Given this testimony, Frazier\u2019s failure to refute this testimony and, despite Frazier\u2019s claims of failed memory, a record on appeal replete with examples of Frazier's relatively good memory, that Frazier made false statements to the grand jury is clear beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWe reject here, as well, Frazier\u2019s argument that McDonald prohibits the prosecutor from speaking about her defense counsel. Frazier contends that McDonald extended the principle set forth in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) (prosecutor may not use defendant\u2019s silence at trial to impute guilt), to prohibit prosecutors from talking about defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to counsel of choice. While we think there is something to this analysis, we recognize the Supreme Court has limited the prohibitions placed upon the prosecutor\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s silence at trial and we extend that limitation to a prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s selection of counsel. In United States v. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988), the Court refused to read Griffin so broadly that \u201cany \u2018direct\u2019 reference by the prosecutor to the failure of the defendant to testify violates the Fifth Amendment as construed in Griffin.\u201d Id. at 31, 108 S.Ct. at 868-69. As in Darden and Young, the Court viewed the prosecutor\u2019s comments in context, id. at 33, 108 S.Ct. at 869 (citing Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)), and stated that,\nIt is one thing to hold, as we did in Griffin, that the prosecutor may not treat a defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent at trial as substantive evidence of guilt; it is quite another to urge ... that the same reasoning would forbid the prosecutor from fairly responding to an argument by the defendant by adverting to that silence.... [W]e decline to expand Griffin to preclude a fair response by the prosecutor in situations such as the present one.\nId. at 34, 108 S.Ct. at 870.\nHere, we similarly refuse to expand McDonald to preclude totally references to a defendant\u2019s use of counsel. Prosecutors may not use the simple fact of representation by counsel to imply a defendant is guilty; but when the defendant\u2019s particular choice of counsel is relevant to an issue (such as, means or motive) in dispute, defense counsel is not exempt from being talked about at trial. This kind of discussion is especially permissible when the prosecutor is responding to a potentially misleading argument by defense counsel.\nAgain, the point of the prosecutor\u2019s mentioning defense counsel here was not simply that Frazier had a lawyer (which, in itself, might be improper argument), but that the lawyer was a link between Frazier and her employer whom she seemed to have lied to protect. The lawyer as a tie between employer and employee was a fair, relevant and permissible argument.\nIn this case, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not improperly infringe upon Frazier\u2019s right to counsel or unfairly prejudice her case. \u201c[I]t is particularly important for appellate courts to relive the whole trial imaginatively.... [Ejach case necessarily turns on its own facts.\u201d Young, 470 U.S. at 16, 105 S.Ct. at 1047 (citations and internal quotations omitted); see also Robinson, 485 U.S. at 35, 36, 108 S.Ct. at 869, 870; cf. Darden, 477 U.S. at 179-80, 106 S.Ct. at 2470-71. Here, the prosecutor responded to defense counsel\u2019s misleading statement that Ghioto or O\u2019Leary could not have found out about the grand jury proceedings. That the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about O\u2019Leary\u2019s role as a conduit might have been inappropriate, see supra note 6, does not elevate them to the level of plain error.\nCONCLUSION\nBecause we conclude that evidence about who paid for Frazier\u2019s legal fees was properly admitted into evidence and that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during trial did not violate Frazier\u2019s constitutional rights or prejudice her case, the conviction is AFFIRMED.\n. We find meritless Frazier\u2019s arguments that she was denied a fair trial by the following means: a grand juror\u2019s testimony that called her testimony before the grand jury \"evasive\"; alleged prosecutorial vouching for evidence; the district court\u2019s failure to rule on a motion to exclude evidence until after defense counsel\u2019s opening argument; the district court\u2019s refusal to use requested jury instructions; and the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper references to Frazier's theory of defense. We also find meritless Frazier's arguments that, because her misstatements to the grand jury were immaterial and because of the insufficiency of the evidence, the district court erred in failing to grant a judgment of acquittal.\n. This court adopted as precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decided before October 1, 1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc).\n. Because the treatment of Frazier\u2019s legal representation figures prominently in our analysis, we will quote at some length from the trial transcript. The payment of Frazier\u2019s legal fees was raised during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Frazier:\nQ: Mrs. Frazier, you were subpoenaed to appear before the Grand Jury October 24th 1989, correct?\nA: Yes.\nQ: And you, in fact, did appear without having talked to an attorney; is that correct? A: Yes.\nQ: And sometime between October 24th, 1989 and November 28th, 1989 you were, in fact, subpoenaed again to appear before the Grand Jury; is that correct?\nA: Yes.\nQ: And you, in fact, were offered a lawyer by Royal Buick to be paid for by Royal Buick to represent you during your appearance November 28th, 1989, correct?\nA: Yes.\nQ: And the gentleman who represented you during that appearance is Mr. Buck O\u2019Leary who is sitting right over here; is that correct?\nA: That\u2019s right.\nQ: And he was, in fact, at that time being paid by Royal Buick by Mr. Ghioto for your representation, correct?\nA: Yes.\nQ: How was it, Mrs. Frazier, that you came to obtain Mr. O\u2019Leary to represent you at the November 28th appearance before the Grand Jury?\nA: After I went to the first hearing, it frightened me so bad that I talked to my family about it and they said that before I went back to another one that I should see an attorney. And everyone that was subpoenaed to go that day was giving \u2014 was told that they could go see Dykema Gossett.\nQ: Dykema Gossett\u2019s the name of the law firm; is that correct?\nA: Yes.\nQ: And were you told at that time that Mr. Ghioto was personally represented by that law firm?\nA: No, I did not know that he was personally represented.\nMr. O\u2019Leary: I object, Your Honor. We don\u2019t represent Mr. Ghioto personally.\nR.6 at 61-63. The prosecutor later impeached this portion of Frazier\u2019s testimony by showing her an affidavit signed by her indicating that she thought Ghioto was represented by Dykema Gossett in some aspects of the criminal investigation.\n. During the prosecutor's opening statement, he said:\nWe expect to prove that when Mrs. Frazier testified the first time in the Grand Jury, she was not represented by an attorney.... The second time we expect the evidence to show that she was represented by an attorney, which is her right, obviously, when she appeared in November. We expect to prove those attorneys were also attorneys for Royal Buick, which, of course, is the target of this investigations, and its owner, Mr. Ghioto.\nWe expect to prove to you that the defendant, Mrs. Frazier made the false declarations that she did for the purposes related to the ongoing investigation into the activities of Royal Buick and her employer, Mr. Ghioto in [an] effort to frustrate, to impede the Grand Jury from learning about whether or not her employer was knowingly involved in the underlying fraudulent activity. We expect to prove that at his urging she was told, don\u2019t talk about things like that if you value your job. We expect to prove that she followed her marching orders in the Grand Jury, and knowingly made false statements for that very purpose, and we expect that the motive for her to make the false statements that she did is a significant factor in this case, one that you\u2019ll need to consider.\nR.3 at 18-19.\n. Frazier\u2019s legal representation came up after the prosecutor\u2019s initial closing argument, at which time Frazier\u2019s attorney made these statements in his closing argument:\nGrand Jury proceedings are secret, not even the witness\u2019s lawyer is permitted to be in the Grand Jury room with the witness. So, when Mrs. Frazier is in the Grand Jury room on October 24, she\u2019s perfectly free to tell the Grand Jury whatever she wants about Ralph Ghioto. And neither Ralph Ghioto nor Ralph Ghioto\u2019s lawyer nor anybody else is going to know what she says for a long time to come, if ever.\nNow, that raises another significant question because when Mrs. Frazier appears before the Grand Jury on October 24, 1989, she doesn't even have a lawyer. Now, doesn\u2019t that raise some significant questions in your mind right there? I mean, if this conversation with Mr. Ghioto took place where she is told to keep her mouth shut, and if she then had this unforgettable conversation with David Wilkerson where she told him about the conversation with Ghioto and she\u2019s in league with Mr. Ghioto to cover up the truth, what on earth is she doing down there in the Grand Jury on October 24 without a lawyer? If he did, I would suggest it could be one of the dumbest things he could ever do.\n... I suggest that if Mr. Ghioto and Mrs. Frazier were really in cahoots together, Mrs. Frazier wouldn\u2019t be down there on October 24 without a lawyer, she would be down there with an army of lawyers and she wouldn\u2019t be answering any questions whatsoever.\nR.7 at 101-02. The prosecutor then argued against this defense proposition in his closing rebuttal argument:\nMr. O'Leary mentions that it doesn\u2019t make sense that Royal Buick would allow Ms. Frazier to go to the Grand Jury without a lawyer the first time and knowing what she knew about Mr. Ghioto.\nWell, to begin with, they are not supposed to see that she has a lawyer at any time. That\u2019s her business, not Royal Buick\u2019s. She\u2019s a free human being and isn\u2019t supposed to be under the thumb of Ghioto and Royal Buick to the extent that they supply her with lawyers so that they can keep track of them. That isn\u2019t supposed to happen. That isn\u2019t normal. I point out that it happened in this case, but the evidence that has been introduced in evidence in this trial proves beyond a reasonable doubt that, as Mr. O\u2019Leary said, they didn\u2019t know what the Grand Jury wanted to ask the first time. They didn\u2019t have any idea. So, there wasn\u2019t any real noise. There wasn\u2019t any real knowledge for concern on the part of Royal Buick.\nThe second time there was. They knew what was asked. Mr. O\u2019Leary suggests, well, the Grand Jury is secret. Why, nobody can find out what went on in there. Well, that\u2019s not totally true. The Grand Jury secrecy rules don\u2019t apply to the witnesses. Mrs. Frazier can tell anybody what happened and she did. She told her lawyers, and her lawyers told Mr. Ghioto. You can infer that. And the next time she was subpoenaed, Royal Buick's lawyers are there because they know what\u2019s coming. They knew what she was asked the first time, and as [the other prosecutor] told you, they knew they were going to be asked about Mr. Christie the second time.\nR.7 at 116-17 (emphasis added).\n. Although we need not reach the issue because of defense counsel\u2019s lack of contemporaneous objection, we remain unpersuaded that this comment would rise even to the level of error at all. The record does not provide sufficient facts to determine the issue conclusively, but if Dyke-ma Gossett were representing Frazier during the grand jury appearances in her capacity as one of the Royal Buick's employees, it may well be that O\u2019Leary could ethically provide information to Ghioto, especially if the lawyer had Frazier\u2019s consent. Under this set of circumstances, the jury could reasonably infer that O'Leary was acting as a conduit between Frazier and Ghioto. We stress that nowhere in the record does the prosecutor say that O\u2019Leary counselled Frazier to lie or that he acted unethically or illegally \u2014 if he had, our analysis might change.\n. In this regard, we reject Frazier's reliance on Greenfield v. Wainwright, 741 F.2d 329 (11th Cir.1984). In Greenfield, a defendant who claimed insanity sought counsel after being arrested. In that case we held only that the defendant seeking counsel was not probative of sanity. Id. at 334. Greenfield does not stand for the proposition that a prosecutor is prohibited entirely from mentioning defense counsel.",

        "text": "JOHNSON, Circuit Judge,\ndissenting:\nThe majority largely ignores many significant misstatements and improper comments by the prosecutor in his closing statement. Because I find that these un-proprieties rise to the level of plain error, I dissent.\nDuring the closing, the prosecutor alluded to acts of perjury that were neither charged nor proved. The prosecutor stated without further explanation that Ms. Frazier made more false statements than those charged. See Brooks v. Kemp, 762 F.2d 1383, 1403 (11th Cir.1985) (attorney may not hint that he has additional evidence he has not produced), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1022, 106 S.Ct. 3337, 92 L.Ed.2d 742 (1986). The prosecutor moreover misrepresented to the jury that Ms. Frazier did not tell the grand jury that her medical problems caused her to forget about the conversations. See U.S. v. Valentine, 820 F.2d 565, 570 (2d Cir.1987) (reversal required when prosecutor knowingly misrepresented defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony).\nThe prosecutor impermissibly expressed his personal opinion about defendant\u2019s guilt by asserting that Ms. Frazier\u2019s memory defense was a post hoc coverup for her lies. See U.S. v. Stefan, 784 F.2d 1093, 1100 (11th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 855, 107 S.Ct. 193, 93 L.Ed.2d 125 (1986); see also, ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, \u00a7 3-5.8(b) (1986) (\u201cIt is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence or the guilt of the defendant.\u201d). Furthermore, he unfairly maligned defendant\u2019s counsel by making statements such as \u201cthe defense and the presentation you saw was garbage.\u201d See U.S. v. McLain, 823 F.2d 1457, 1462 (11th Cir.1987).\nThe prosecutor also grossly exaggerated the weakness of defendant\u2019s defense by repeatedly characterizing it as utterly mer-itless. Although a prosecutor \u201cmay strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). A prosecutor may even describe a defense as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201ca big fake\u201d as long as the trial record supports the prosecutor\u2019s comments. United States v. Caldwell, 543 F.2d 1333, 1361-62 (D.C.Cir.1974), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1087, 96 S.Ct. 877, 47 L.Ed.2d 97 (1976). In this case, however, it is undisputed that Ms. Frazier actually had blockage of her carotid artery, that she suffered a transient ischemic attack, that she took prescription drugs which slowed her responsiveness, and that she suffered memory loss. What was contested was whether these conditions prevented her from remembering two conversations which occurred several years before. The prosecutor\u2019s repeated reference to the defense as \u201cgarbage,\u201d \u201cmush,\u201d \u201cabsurd,\u201d a \u201csmoke screen,\u201d and an \u201cexcuse for perjury\u201d amounted to a flurry of \u201cfoul blows.\u201d Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633.\nIn light of Ms. Frazier\u2019s colorable arguments, the prosecutor failed to compile the overwhelming evidence of guilt necessary to render harmless his many improprieties. See Francis v. Dugger, 908 F.2d 696, 701 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1696, 114 L.Ed.2d 90 (1991). Moreover, the trial court failed to cure the prosecutor\u2019s errors through jury instructions. See United States v. Lopez, 898 F.2d 1505, 1511-12 (11th Cir.1990). I therefore find that the prosecutor\u2019s improprieties \u201c \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2471, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the conviction.\n. I do not address the majority\u2019s other ruling since I find this issue dispositive.\n. The attack, similar to a stroke, rendered her temporarily blind and paralyzed.",
