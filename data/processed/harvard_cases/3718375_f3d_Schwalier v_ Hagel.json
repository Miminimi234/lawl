        "text": "Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge SENTELLE.\nSENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judge.\nRetired Brigadier General Terryl Schwalier brought this action in the district court seeking, inter alia, \u201ccorrection\u201d of his military records to reflect promotion to major general, along with active duty back pay and retired pay. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of Defense. Schwalier appeals. Because the jurisdiction of the district court was based, at least in part, on the Little Tucker Act, we conclude that the Federal Circuit possesses exclusive jurisdiction over this appeal, and we therefore transfer Schwalier\u2019s appeal to that court.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe published opinion of the district court sets forth the procedural and factual background of this litigation in some detail. See Schwalier v. Panetta, 839 F.Supp.2d 75 (D.D.C.2012). We will therefore provide only the details pertinent to our jurisdictional analysis.\nIn 1995, then President Clinton nominated Brigadier General Terryl J. Schwalier for promotion to major general, and the Senate confirmed his nomination in 1996. Id. at 77. President Clinton subsequently removed Schwalier\u2019s name from the promotion list, and in 1997 Schwalier retired in the grade of brigadier general.\nSchwalier petitioned the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records (\u201cBoard\u201d) in 2003. He requested a correction of his records to reflect promotion to major general, effective January 1, 1997; retirement, as a major general; and receipt of appropriate back pay. In 2004, the Board recommended granting Schwalier\u2019s request, concluding that he had been promoted by operation of law before the President removed his name from the list in 1997. The Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d) rejected the Board\u2019s decision and determined that the action of the Board was ultra vires and without legal effect. Based on the DOD analysis, the Board notified Schwalier that he was not promoted \u201cby authority of the President or otherwise, prior to the President taking personal action to remove [his] name from the promotion list.\u201d\nSchwalier petitioned the Board for reconsideration in 2007. The Board again recommended correction, the Air Force adopted the recommendation, and the DOD intervened, directing the DOD Comptroller not to pay Schwalier as directed by the Air Force. In response, the Air Force again rescind\u00e9d the \u201ccorrections\u201d of Schwalier\u2019s records.\nOn January 20, 2011, Schwalier filed suit against the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of Defense. Schwalier alleged that the DOD had unlawfully interfered with the records corrections favorable to Schwalier, and that the Air Force had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in acquiescing to that interference. According to Schwalier, neither the Secretary of Defense nor the Secretary of the Air Force could legally reverse relief once granted, because records corrections issued by the Air Force are \u201cfinal and conclusive on all officers of the United States.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a)(4).\nIn his complaint, Schwalier sought equitable and declaratory relief reinstating the Board\u2019s favorable decisions, as well as an order enjoining the DOD from interfering with further correction actions. Schwalier \u201cexpressly waive[d] any right or entitlement to recover monetary damages greater than $10,000 in this action,\u201d as a consequence of filing his \u201ccomplaint in this Honorable Court.\u201d And in the final paragraph of his prayer for relief, Schwalier requested \u201cany other relief, including active duty pay and retired pay, as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to provide complete and full relief to Plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled in favor of the Secretaries. Schwalier, 839 F.Supp.2d at 86. Because the jurisdiction of the court below was based in part on the Little Tucker Act, we transfer this appeal to the Federal Circuit.\nII. ANALYSIS\nThe Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over claims against the United States for \u201cliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1); Smalls v. United States, 471 F.3d 186, 189 (D.C.Cir.2006). The Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, provides an exception, vesting district courts with concurrent jurisdiction for \u201ccivil action[s] or claim[s] against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2). In 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2), the statute grants \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over appeals from decisions of the district - courts when \u201cthe jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part,\u201d on the Little Tucker Act. By granting exclusive jurisdiction over such cases to the Federal Circuit, the Act divests us of appellate jurisdiction over claims that \u201c(1) seek money (2) not exceeding $10,000 (3) from the United States and (4) [are] founded\u201d upon an \u201cAct of Congress ... that can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damages sustained.\u201d Van Drasek v. Lehman, 762 F.2d 1065, 1068 (D.C.Cir.1985) (internal quotations omitted).\nOn the face of the complaint, it would appear that these four criteria are met: Schwalier seeks back pay and retirement pay; he expressly waives an amount exceeding $10,000; the action is brought against the Secretaries in their official capacity as Officers of the United States; and the claim/action finally rests upon the statutory structure for payment of military personnel and correction of relevant records. Before this court, Schwalier does not contest the last three of the criteria, but asserts that his complaint does not \u201cseek money ... for damages\u201d within the meaning of the Act. It is on this element that the parties have joined issue, and it is solely this issue which we must determine in order to answer the jurisdictional question.\nSchwalier asserts that the Little Tucker Act cannot apply because his \u201ccomplaint does not contain any request for money damages.\u201d He forwards two related arguments for why his claim is not monetary in nature. First Schwalier focuses on the structure of his complaint, and argues that neither his request for back pay nor his waiver of damages over $10,000 sufficiently raises a monetary claim requiring a transfer. Schwalier\u2019s only monetary reference appears in the final paragraph of his prayer for relief, in which he requests \u201cany other relief, including active duty back pay and retired pay, as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to provide complete and full relief to Plaintiff.\u201d Compl. Prayer for Relief \u00b6 (M). This Court is duty-bound to \u201cgrant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(c). Schwalier characterizes the last paragraph of his complaint as an invocation of this duty, and notes that we have held such invocations to be surplus-age, and thus of no consequence to our jurisdictional analysis. Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1524 (D.C.Cir.1986); see also Viet. Veterans of Am. v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 534 (D.C.Cir.1988). Schwalier reasons that his reference to back pay is likewise surplusage, and therefore, it too has no bearing on this court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nIt does not appear to us that our decision in Sharp solves Schwalier\u2019s problem. The plaintiff in Sharp did not seek money damages in any direct form. The language of the complaint discussed in the Sharp decision sought \u201call other relief deemed just and proper.\u201d It was that language that we deemed surplusage. Schwalier, on the other hand, explicitly seeks relief that \u201cinclude[s] active duty back pay and retired pay.\u201d It cannot be gainsaid that had the plaintiff himself calculated the back pay and retired pay and sought the explicit amount, that would create a monetary claim, and, all other requirements being met, place this appeal in the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit under the Little Tucker Act. We do not know whether the use of words rather than numbers represents intentionally artful pleading or simply a stylistic choice, but we cannot allow it to control. To permit plaintiffs to evade the strictures of the Tucker Act by setting forth the formula for their monetary relief rather than asking for a specified amount of \u201cdamages\u201d in so many words would undo the carefully erected structure that Congress set forth. We further note that by explicitly waiving damages over $10,000, Schwalier has apparently deliberately brought himself within the terms of the Little Tucker Act but for the disputed question of a monetary claim which, as we describe above, he has made without calculating its total.\nSchwalier\u2019s second argument goes more broadly to the nature or \u201ccore\u201d of his action. He sought equitable and declaratory relief. Any monetary recovery would come from a favorable decision by the Board, not the court. Schwalier likens his case to Smalls, in which the plaintiff sought \u201cin essence ... declaratory or in-junctive relief that is not negligible in comparison with the potential monetary recovery.\u201d Smalls, 471 F.3d at 190 (internal quotations omitted). As in Smalls, Schwa-lier challenges the denial of relief from a records-eorrection board. See id. And as in Smalls, Schwalier filed his suit \u201cprimarily to correct his military records.\u201d See id. (emphasis in the original). As counsel described it at oral argument, Schwalier\u2019s is not a \u201cback pay\u201d action or a \u201cmoney case,\u201d but an APA action, and this is how the district court treated it.\nThe Secretaries argue in response that neither the intent of the litigant nor the treatment of the district court governs our analysis. The question of jurisdiction is answered by the language of the complaint, and in his complaint Schwalier explicitly requested monetary relief. It is immaterial that Schwalier\u2019s complaint included an APA claim; his action need only be based \u201cin part\u201d on the Little Tucker Act to divest us of appellate jurisdiction, even if it was also based in part on the APA. The Secretaries have the better argument.\nWe only look to the essence of a complaint in the absence of an explicit request for monetary relief. See, e.g., Kidwell v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 56 F.3d 279, 285 (D.C.Cir.1995) (\u201c[Pjlaintiff here has not explicitly requested monetary relief....\u201d); Tootle v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 169 (D.C.Cir.2006) (\u201cTootle\u2019s complaint does not explicitly request money damages.\u201d). Because Schwalier has included such a request on the face of the complaint, there is no need to peer deeper into its substance, essence, or \u201ccore.\u201d See Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284. Even in Smalls, our decision hinged on ambiguity in the language of the complaint. There we found a reference to \u201cretirement benefits\u201d insufficient to create a monetary claim because \u201cthe phrase \u2018retirement benefits\u2019 connotes a host of benefits to which no monetary value can be attached,\u201d and any disability pay the plaintiff could have received \u201cwould, come as a result of administrative proceedings ... and not as a result of the adjudication of the claims in\u201d the plaintiffs complaint. Smalls, 471 F.3d at 190-91. Schwalier\u2019s request for back pay, on the other hand, is unambiguously monetary in nature, and he requested it directly from the court. In light of this explicit request, we need not examine the complaint in greater detail.\nIn sum, Schwalier sought back pay, and the explicit nature of his request obviates the need to examine his claim\u2019s essence. Moreover, the location of the monetary request in his complaint is immaterial to our jurisdictional analysis. Ultimately, Schwalier requested (1) back pay (2) not exceeding $10,000 that, if granted, would (3) come from the Federal Government, and (4) his substantive claim was founded upon 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552, an Act of Congress we have held can \u201cfairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government.\u201d Van Drasek, 762 F.2d at 1068, 1071 (back pay request). Accordingly, Schwalier\u2019s action below was based \u201cin part\u201d on the Little Tucker Act, and we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. See id. at 1072.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we transfer this appeal to the Federal Circuit.\nSo ordered.",
