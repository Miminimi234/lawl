        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFUENTES, Circuit Judge:\nKristie Bell and Joan Luppe are the named plaintiffs in a class action complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) filed against Cheswick Generating Station, GenOn Power Midwest, L.P. (\u201cGenOn\u201d). The putative class (the \u201cClass\u201d) is made up of at least 1,500 individuals who own or inhabit residential property within one mile of GenOn\u2019s Che-swick Generating Station, a 570-megawatt coal-fired electrical generation facility in Spring dale, Pennsylvania (the \u201cPlant\u201d).\nComplaining of ash and contaminants settling on their property, the Class brought suit against GenOn under several state law tort theories. GenOn argued that because the Plant was subject to comprehensive regulation under the Clean Air Act, it owed no extra duty to the members of the Class under state tort law. The District Court agreed with GenOn and dismissed the case. On appeal, we are faced with a matter of first impression: whether the Clean Air Act preempts state law tort claims brought by private property owners against a source of pollution located within the state. Based on the plain language of the Clean Air Act and controlling Supreme Court precedent, we conclude that such source state common law actions are not preempted. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings.\nI. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\nA. Environmental Regulation Under the Clean Air Act\nThe Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 et seq., enacted in 1970, is a comprehensive federal law that regulates air emissions under the auspices of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d). Congress enacted the law in response to evidence of the increasing amount of air pollution created by the industrialization and urbanization of the United States and its threat to public health and welfare. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401(a)(2). The Clean Air Act states that air pollution prevention and control is the primary responsibility of individual states and local governments but that federal financial assistance and leadership is essential to accomplish these goals. Id. \u00a7 7401(a)(3)-(4). Thus, it employs a \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d structure under which the federal government develops baseline standards that the states individually implement and enforce. GenOn REMA, LLC v. EPA, 722 F.3d 513, 516, No. 12-1022, 2013 WL 3481486, at *1 (3d Cir. July 12, 2013). In so doing, states are expressly allowed to employ standards more stringent than those specified by the federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7416.\nThe Clean Air Act makes the EPA responsible for developing acceptable national ambient air quality standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d), which are meant to set a uniform level of air quality across the country in order to protect the populace and the environment. Id. \u00a7 7409(b)(1). Before such levels are adopted or modified by the EPA, \u201ca reasonable time for interested persons to submit written comments\u201d must be provided. Id. \u00a7 7409(a)(1)(B). The EPA itself does not typically regulate individual sources of emissions. Instead, decisions regarding how to meet NAAQS are left to individual states. Id. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). Pursuant to this goal, each state is required to create and submit to the EPA a State Implementation Plan (\u201cSIP\u201d) which provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of NAAQS within the state. Id. All SIPs must be submitted to the EPA for approval before they become final, and once a SIP is approved, \u201cits requirements become federal law and are fully enforceable in federal court.\u201d Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Ontario v. Detroit, 874 F.2d 332, 335 (6th Cir.1989) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a)).\nStates are tasked with enforcing the limitations they adopt in their SIPs. They must regulate all stationary sources located within the areas covered by the SIPs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(C), and implement a mandatory permit program that limits the amounts and types of emissions that each stationary source is allowed to discharge, id. \u00a7\u00a7 7661a(d)(l), 7661c(a). \u201c[E]ach permit is intended to be a source-specific bible for Clean Air Act compliance containing in a single, comprehensive set of documents, all [Clean Air Act] requirements relevant to the particular polluting source.\u201d North Carolina, ex rel.

Modes of Redress Under the CAA\nThe Clean Air Act contains a \u201ccitizen suit\u201d provision, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604, which permits the filing of civil suits in district courts \u201cagainst any person ... who is alleged to have violated ... or to be in violation of (A) an emission standard or limitation under this chapter or (B) an order issued by the Administrator or a State with respect to such a standard or limitation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7604(a)(1). The statute further grants a cause of action against the EPA if it fails to perform any non-discretionary responsibility, id. \u00a7 7604(a)(2), and also allows suit against any entity that constructs a source of emissions without securing the requisite permits. Id. \u00a7 7604(a)(3). Furthermore, the EPA \u201cretains the power to inspect and monitor regulated sources, to impose administrative penalties for noncompliance, and to commence civil actions against polluters in federal court.\u201d Am. Elec. Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 2538, 180 L.Ed.2d 435 (2011).\nThe citizen suit provision contains a \u201csavings clause\u201d which provides, in pertinent part:\nNothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any emission standard or limitation or to seek any other relief (including relief against the Administrator or a State agency).\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(e). This is the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201ccitizen suit savings clause.\u201d\nThe Clean Air Act also contains a separate savings clause entitled \u201cRetention of State authority,\u201d codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7416. This provision focuses on states\u2019 rights, and reads as follows:\nExcept as otherwise provided ... nothing in this chapter shall preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce (1) any standard or limitation respecting emissions of air pollutants or (2) any requirement respecting control or abatement of air pollution....\nId. \u00a7 7416. This is the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cstates\u2019 rights savings clause.\u201d\nC. Regulation at the Cheswick Plant\nFederal, state, and local authorities extensively regulate and comprehensively oversee the operations of the Cheswick Plant pursuant to their authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and the Allegheny County Health Department comprise the administrative bodies that are primarily responsible for defining environmental emission standards and policing compliance with the Clean Air Act at the Plant. As discussed above, at the EPA\u2019s direction and with its approval, states issue operating permits for all stationary sources under Subchapter V of the Clean Air Act. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7661a-f Subchapter V program authority has in this instance been delegated to Allegheny County. GenOn\u2019s Subchapter V permit for Cheswick (the \u201cPermit\u201d) imposes limits on the emission of various particulate matter, gases, chemical, and compounds from coal combustion. See App. 91-161.\nThe Permit collects all the operational requirements that are contained in Sub-chapter V of the Clean Air Act, and approved by the EPA. It specifically provides that GenOn may not \u201coperate ... any source in such manner that emissions of malodorous matter from such source are perceptible beyond the property line,\u201d App. 106 (\u00a7 IV.3); must \u201ctake all reasonable actions to prevent fugitive air contaminants from becoming airborne,\u201d App. 112 (\u00a7 IV.19); may not \u201cconduct ... any materials handling operation in such manner that emissions from such operation are visible at or beyond the property line,\u201d App. 106 (\u00a7 IV.4); must ensure that \u201c[a]ll air pollution control equipment\u201d is \u201cproperly installed, maintained, and operated,\u201d App. 106 (\u00a7 IV.5); and may not \u201coperate any source ... in such manner that emissions from such source ... [m]ay reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health, safety, or welfare.\u201d App. 96 (\u00a7 III.1).\nHowever, it also provides that \u201cnothing in this permit relieves the permittee from the obligation to comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local Laws and regulations,\u201d App. 96 (Declaration of Policy), and contains a savings clause which provides that:\nNothing in this permit shall be construed as impairing any right or remedy now existing or hereafter created in equity, common law or statutory law with respect to air pollution, nor shall any court be deprived of such jurisdiction for the reason that such air pollution constitutes a violation of this permit.\nApp. 102 (\u00a7 III.31).\nII. GENERAL FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW\nA. The Complaint\nThe Complaint alleges that GenOn\u2019s operation, maintenance, control, and use of the Plant releases malodorous substances and particulates into the surrounding neighborhood, causing fly ash and unburned coal combustion byproducts to settle onto the Class members\u2019 property as a \u201cblack dust/film ... or white powder\u201d which requires constant cleaning. App. 9. These odors and particulates are harmful and noxious and have caused substantial damage to Class members\u2019 property and the loss of their ability to use and enjoy their properties, making them \u201cprisoners in their [own] homes.\u201d App. 12. The operation of the Plant has been the subject of numerous and constant complaints by the residents of the surrounding neighborhood and by organizations and interested persons within the area. However, these complaints have not compelled GenOn to cease the improper operation of the Plant or to discontinue the ongoing invasion and trespass of the Class members\u2019 properties. The Complaint alleges that GenOn knows of the \u201cimproper construction, and operation of the [Plant], which allows discharge\u201d of these particulates, yet \u201ccontinues to operate the [Plant] without proper or best available technology, or any proper air pollution control equipment.\u201d App. 12-13.\nBased on these allegations, the Class seeks to recover compensatory and punitive damages under three state common law tort theories: (1) nuisance; (2) negligence and recklessness; and (3) trespass. Although the Complaint also seeks injunctive relief on the nuisance and trespass counts, the Class admits that such relief would be limited to an order requiring GenOn to remove the particulate that continuously falls upon the Class members\u2019 properties. Oral Arg. at 13:50; Bell, 903 F.Supp.2d at 318.\nB. The District Court Decision\nIn July 2012, GenOn removed the case to the Western District of Pennsylvania invoking the District Court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, and promptly moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the state law tort claims were preempted by the Clean Air Act. It argued that allowing such claims to go forward \u201cwould undermine the [Clean Air Act]\u2019s comprehensive scheme, and make it impossible for regulators to strike their desired balance in implementing emissions standards.\u201d App. 84. In October 2012 the District Court granted GenOn\u2019s motion, finding that the Clean Air Act preempted all of the Class\u2019s state law claims.\nThe District Court began by summarizing the extensive regulatory framework governing the Plant. It then reviewed the Complaint and determined that \u201cthe allegations of Plaintiffs, as pleaded, assert various permit violations and seek a judicial examination of matters governed by the regulating administrative bodies.\u201d Bell, 903 F.Supp.2d at 320. Thus, it moved on to examine \u201cwhether the Clean Air Act preempts the state common law claims or whether the savings clause in the citizen suit provision allow those claims to survive.\u201d Id. at 321. After discussing the relevant case law, the District Court concluded that, \u201c[biased on the extensive and comprehensive regulations promulgated by tile administrative bodies which govern air emissions from electrical generation facilities, the Court finds and rules that to permit the common law claims would be inconsistent with the dictates of the Clean Air Act.\u201d Id. at 322. The Court found that the \u201csavings clause of the Clean Air Act does not alter this analysis.\u201d Id. The Class now appeals this decision.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Preemption Analysis\nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution states:\nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\nU.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Supremacy Clause as preempting any state law that \u201cinterferes with or is contrary to federal law.\u201d Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 663, 666, 82 S.Ct. 1089, 8 L.Ed.2d 180 (1962). \u201cFederal law can preempt state law in three ways: (1) express preemption, (2) field preemption, and (3) conflict preemption.\u201d Farina v. Nokia, 625 F.3d 97, 115 (3d Cir.2010). \u201cConflict preemption nullifies state law inasmuch as it conflicts with federal law, either where compliance with both laws is impossible or where state law erects an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). GenOn argues that state tort law conflicts with the objectives of the Clean Air Act, because it \u201cwould undermine the [Act]\u2019s comprehensive scheme and rival the work of regulators as they strike their desired balance in implementing emissions standards.\u201d Appellee Br. at 26.\n1. Legal Precedent\nWhile the extent to which the Clean Air Act preempts state law tort claims against an in-state source of pollution is a matter of first impression in this Circuit, the Supreme Court has addressed this issue in the context of a similarly comprehensive environmental statute: the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251, et seq. In International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987), the Court was asked to determine whether the Clean Water Act preempted a Vermont common law nuisance suit filed in Vermont state court, where the source of the alleged injury was located in New York. Plaintiffs, a group of property owners who resided on the Vermont (\u201caffected state\u201d) shore of Lake Champlain, alleged that the defendant paper company, which operated a pulp and paper mill on the New York (\u201csource state\u201d) side of the lake, was discharging \u201ceffluents\u201d into the lake, polluting the water and thereby diminishing the value of their property. Id. at 484, 107 S.Ct. 805. Defendants argued that the Clean Water Act preempted the court from applying Vermont state law against a source of pollution located in New York. In response, Plaintiffs argued that the Clean Water Act\u2019s savings clauses indicated \u201cthat Congress intended to preserve the right to bring suit under the law of any affected State.\u201d Id. at 493, 107 S.Ct. 805.\nLike the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act contains two savings clauses, one located in the citizen suit provision, and another which focuses on states\u2019 rights. Section \u00a7 505(e) of the Clean Water Act, which is located in the Act\u2019s citizen suit provision, states:\nNothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief....\n33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(e). Section 510 of the Clean Water Act focuses on states\u2019 rights, and provides:\nExcept as expressly provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall (1) preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof or interstate agency to adopt or enforce (A) any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants, or (B) any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution; ... or (2) be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the States with respect to the waters (including boundary waters) of such States.\nId. \u00a7 1370.\nThe Ouellette Court found that the Clean Water Act\u2019s savings clauses clearly preserved some state law tort actions, but that the text of the clauses did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether suits based on the law of the affected state were preempted. 479 U.S. at 492, 497, 107 S.Ct. 805. However, it found definitively that \u201cnothing in the [Clean Water Act] bars aggrieved individuals from bringing a nuisance claim pursuant to the laws of the source State.\u201d Id. at 497, 107 S.Ct. 805 (emphasis in original). The Court reasoned that, \u201c[b]y its terms the Clean Water Act allows States ... to impose higher standards on their own point sources,\u201d and \u201cthis authority may include the right to impose higher common-law as well as higher statutory restrictions.\u201d Id. (internal citation omitted). The Court acknowledged that a source state\u2019s \u201cnuisance law may impose separate standards and thus create some tension with the permit system,\u201d but explained that this \u201cwould not frustrate the goals of the Clean Water Act,\u201d because \u201ca source only is required to look to a single additional authority, whose rules should be relatively predictable.\u201d Id. at 498-99, 107 5.Ct. 805. Thus, a suit by Vermont citizens would not be preempted if brought under the law of New York, the source state.\nGenOn argues that Ouellette is distinguishable from this case because the savings clauses of the Clean Water Act are broader than the corresponding provisions in the Clean Air Act. However, a textual comparison of the two savings clauses at issue demonstrates there is no meaningful difference between them.\nAs the Supreme Court has acknowledged, and GenOn concedes, the citizen suit savings clause of the Clean Water Act is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to its counterpart in the Clean Air Act. City of Milwaukee v. Illinois & Michigan, 451 U.S. 304, 328, 101 S.Ct. 1784, 68 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981); Appellee Br. at 30. Thus, GenOn\u2019s argument hinges on its expansive reading of the Clean Water Act\u2019s states\u2019 rights savings clause, which again provides:\nExcept as expressly provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall (1) preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof or interstate agency to adopt or enforce (A) any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants, or (B) any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution; ... or (2) be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the States with respect to the waters (including boundary waters) of such States.\n33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1370 (emphasis added). By way of comparison, the states\u2019 rights savings clause of the Clean Air Act provides:\nExcept as otherwise provided ... nothing in this chapter shall preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce (1) any standard or limitation respecting emissions of air pollutants or (2) any requirement respecting control or abatement of air pollution....\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7416. As a side-by-side comparison of the text indicates, the only meaningful difference between the two states\u2019 rights savings clauses is the portion of the Clean Water Act italicized above which refers to the boundary waters of the states. The reason why such language is not included the in Clean Air Act is clear: there are no such jurisdictional boundaries or rights which apply to the air. If anything, the absence of any language regarding state boundaries in the states\u2019 rights savings clause of the Clean Air Act indicates that Congress intended to preserve more rights for the states, rather than less. In no way can this omission be read to preempt all state law tort claims.\nThe only other circuit courts to have examined this issue in depth have also found no meaningful distinction between the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. In Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Ontario v. Detroit, 874 F.2d 332 (6th Cir.1989), the Sixth Circuit held that the Clean Air Act did not preempt plaintiffs from suing the City of Detroit under the Michigan Environmental Protection Act (\u201cMEPA\u201d), finding that \u201cthe [Clean Air Act] displaces state law only to the extent that state law is not as strict as emission limitations established in the federal statute.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis removed from original). The court reasoned that \u201cthe plain language of the [Clean Air Act\u2019s] savings clause ... clearly indicates that Congress did not wish to abolish state control,\u201d id. at 342-43, and, relying on Ouellette, concluded:\nIf the plaintiffs succeed in state court, it will simply be an instance where a state is enacting and enforcing more stringent pollution controls as authorized by the [Clean Air Act], With MEPA, the State of Michigan has created a mechanism under which more stringent limitations may be imposed than required by federal law. It is, by its terms, supplemental to other legal and administrative procedures and requirements, and in this case principles of comity and federalism require us to hold these MEPA actions are not preempted by federal law.\nId. at 344.\nIn North Carolina ex rel. Cooper v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 615 F.3d 291 (4th Cir.2010), the state of North Carolina brought a state law public nuisance suit against the Tennessee Valley Authority (\u201cTVA\u201d), a federal agency which owned and operated eleven coal-fired power plants located in Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky. After a bench trial, the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina issued an injunction against four of the TVA plants, imposing emission standards on the plants that were stricter than what was required by the Clean Air Act. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that the district court had incorrectly applied the law of the affected state in violation of Ouellette, and that the TVA plants\u2019 emissions were not a public nuisance under the laws of the source states. In explaining its decision to apply Ouellette, the court noted that the savings clauses of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act are \u201csimilar.\u201d Id. at 304. It also noted that the Clean Water Act is \u201csimilarly comprehensive\u201d to the Clean Air Act, and that \u201c[w]hile Ouellette involved a nuisance suit against a source regulated under the Clean Water Act, all parties agree its holding is equally applicable to the Clean Air Act.\u201d Id. at 306.\nUltimately, as commentators have recognized, \u201cthere is little basis for distinguishing the Clean Air Act from the Clean Water Act \u2014 the two statutes feature nearly identical savings clauses and employ similar \u2018cooperative federalism\u2019 structures.\u201d Scott Gallisdorfer, Note, Clean Air Act Preemption of State Common Law: Greenhouse Gas Nuisance Claims After AEP v. Connecticut, 99 Va. L.Rev. 131, 150 (2013). Both Acts establish a regulatory scheme through which source states, and not affected states, play the primary role in developing the regulations by which a particular source will be bound. Both Acts contain citizen suit provisions which allow individuals to bring suit to enforce their terms under certain circumstances, and both Acts contain two savings clauses: one located within the citizen suit provision which focuses on the rights of individuals to sue, and a second independent savings clause which focuses on states\u2019 rights.\nGiven that we find no meaningful difference between the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act for the purposes of our preemption analysis, we conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ouellette controls this case, and thus, the Clean Air Act does not preempt state common law claims based on the law of the state where the source of the pollution is located. Accordingly, the suit here, brought by Pennsylvania residents under Pennsylvania law against a source of pollution located in Pennsylvania, is not preempted.\n2. Public Policy Considerations\nGenOn argues that our holding may undermine the comprehensive regulatory structure established by the Clean Air Act by allowing the jury and the court to set emissions standards. Furthermore, ami-cus Utility Air Regulatory Group (\u201cUARG\u201d) argues that allowing such cases to move forward would open the proverbial floodgates to nuisance claims against sources in full compliance with federal and state environmental standards, creating a patchwork of inconsistent standards across the country that would compromise Congress\u2019s carefully constructed cooperative federalism framework. Such inconsistency, it argues, would make it extremely difficult for sources to plan and operate, as they would never be sure of precisely what standards apply to their operations.\nHowever, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court addressed this precise problem\u201d in Ouellette, Cooper, 615 F.3d at 301, and rejected the very same concerns that GenOn and UARG now raise. Indeed, while the Ouel-lette Court acknowledged that allowing \u201ca number of different states to have independent and plenary regulatory authority over a single discharge would lead to chaotic confrontation between sovereign states,\u201d 479 U.S. at 496-97, 107 S.Ct. 805 (quoting Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 731 F.2d 403, 414 (7th Cir.1984)), it found that \u201c[a]n action brought ... under [source state] nuisance law would not frustrate the goals of the [Clean Water Act] as would a suit governed by [affected state] law,\u201d id. at 498, 107 S.Ct. 805. Its reasoning was straightforward:\nFirst, application of the source State\u2019s law does not disturb the balance among federal, source-state, and affected-state interests. Because the Act specifically allows source States to impose stricter standards, the imposition of source-state law does not disrupt the regulatory partnership established by the permit system. Second, the restriction of suits to those brought under source-state nuisance law prevents a source from being subject to an indeterminate number of potential regulations. Although [source state] nuisance law may impose separate standards and thus create some tension with the permit system, a source only is required to look to a single additional authority, whose rules should be relatively predictable. Moreover, States can be expected to take into account their own nuisance laws in setting permit requirements.\nId. at 498-99,107 S.Ct. 805.\nThus, the Court recognized that the requirements placed on sources of pollution through the \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d structure of the Clean Water Act served as a regulatory floor, not a ceiling, and expressly held that states are free to impose higher standards on their own sources of pollution, and that state tort law is a permissible way of doing so. Id. at 497-98, 107 S.Ct. 805. Indeed, courts in other circuits have affirmed decisions granting plaintiffs relief against sources of air pollution under state law nuisance theory. See e.g., Ellis v. Gallatin Steel Co., 390 F.3d 461 (6th Cir.2004) (upholding award of in-junctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages for violation of Kentucky nuisance law where \u201cfugitive dust\u201d from defendant\u2019s steel plant settled on plaintiffs\u2019 property).\nB. Political Question Doctrine\nGenOn argues in the alternative that the Class\u2019s claims should be barred by the political question doctrine based on the existence of the Clean Air Act. \u201cThe political question doctrine excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of Congress or the confines of the Executive Branch.\u201d Japan Whaling Ass\u2019n v. Am. Cetacean Soc., 478 U.S. 221, 230, 106 S.Ct. 2860, 92 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986). No court has ever held that such a constitutional commitment of authority regarding the redress of individual property rights for pollution exists in the legislative branch. Indeed, if such a commitment did exist, the Supreme Court would not have decided Ouellette in the first place. Accordingly, we reject this argument.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\u201cIn all pre-emption cases ... we start with the assumption that the ... powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). We see nothing in the Clean Air Act to indicate that Congress intended to preempt source state common law tort claims. If Congress intended to eliminate such private causes of action, \u201cits failure even to hint at\u201d this result would be \u201cspectacularly odd.\u201d Id. at 491, 116 S.Ct. 2240. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ouellette confirms this reading of the statute. Accordingly, we hold that the Class\u2019s claims are not preempted. We will reverse the decision of the District Court and remand this case for further proceedings.\n. The Complaint was filed in April 2012 in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. GenOn is a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware with its organizational headquarters and principal place of business in Houston, Texas. According to GenOn, \"Cheswick Generating Station, GenOn Power Midwest, L.P.\u201d is not a legal entity. However, GenOn admits that it operates the Cheswick Generating Station. See Bell v. Cheswick Generating Station, 903 F.Supp.2d 314, 314 n. 1 (W.D.Pa.2012). The error in the caption does not affect our ruling in any way.\n. The following factual allegations are taken from the Complaint, and we accept them as true for the purposes of this appeal.\n. These particulates include arsenic compounds, barium compounds, chromium compounds, copper compounds, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen fluoride, lead compounds, manganese compounds, mercury compounds, nickel compounds, polycyclic aromatic compounds, sulfuric acid, vanadium compounds, and zinc compounds. App. 10-11.\n.The Class also asserted a strict liability claim, but has conceded that it must fail because power generation is not an ultra-hazardous activity. See Bell, 903 F.Supp.2d at 317.\n. The District Court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we must accept as true all well-pleaded facts and allegations, and must draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiff. Monroe v. Beard, 536 F.3d 198, 205 (3d Cir.2008). A district court's order granting a motion to dismiss is given plenary review. Grier v. Klem, 591 F.3d 672, 676 (3d Cir.2010).\n. Ultimately, the Ouellette Court concluded that \u201cthe [Clean Water Act] precludes a court from applying the law of an affected State against an out-of-state source,\u201d id. at 494, 107 S.Ct. 805, reasoning that if \"affected States were allowed to impose separate discharge standards on a single [out-of-state] point source, the inevitable result would be a serious interference with the achievement of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d id. at 493, 107 S.Ct. 805 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 180 L.Ed.2d 435 (2011), does nothing to alter our analysis. There, the Court held that the Clean Air Act displaced any federal common law right to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants. Id. at 2537. However, the Court acknowledged that \u201c[llegislative displacement of federal common law does not require the same sort of evidence of clear and manifest [congressional] purpose demanded for preemption of state law,\u201d and explicitly left open the question of whether the Clean Air Act preempted state law. Id. at 2537, 2540; see Gallisdorfer, 99 Va.
