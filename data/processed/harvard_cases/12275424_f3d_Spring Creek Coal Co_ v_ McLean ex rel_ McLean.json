        "text": "BRISCOE, Circuit Judge.\nSpring Creek Coal Company (Spring Creek) petitions for review of a decision by the Department of Labor (DOL) awarding survivors\u2019 benefits to Susan McLean under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-944. The DOL concluded that Bradford McLean, Mrs. McLean\u2019s deceased husband, became disabled and died from his exposure to coal dust during the course of his employment at Spring Creek\u2019s surface coal mine. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) and 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a), we deny Spring Creek\u2019s petition.\nI\nFactual background\nBradford McLean was born in Sheridan, Wyoming, on November 23, 1943. In October 1977, Mr. McLean began working for Wyoming-based Big Horn Coal Company (Big Horn). During his time with Big Horn, Mr. McLean worked as a shop laborer, plant laborer, utility oiler, drill helper, drill operator, and truck driver. In the summer of 1986, Mr. McLean left his employment with Big Horn and began working for Montana-based Spring Creek. At Spring Creek, Mr. McLean worked as a utility person, an assistant driller/shooter, and a driller shooter. It is undisputed that all of Mr. McLean\u2019s work occurred above ground in open pit coal mines.\nIn approximately 2001, Mr. McLean for the first time \u201cnoted running out of breath with heavy physical exertion.\u201d Joint App. at 10. Mr. McLean did not immediately seek a medical evaluation of his condition, and instead waited until approximately 2003 to discuss the matter with his primary care physician. \u201c[B]y 2006 he was unable to complete the requirements of employment and eventually was unable to complete activities of daily living ....\u201d Id. at 21. In 2006, Mr. McLean was referred to Dr. Robert Merchant, a pulmonologist in Billings, Montana. According to Mr. McLean, he was told by Dr. Merchant \u201cthat only 29% of his lungs were working\u201d and Dr. Merchant diagnosed him as suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Id. at 10.\nMr. McLean stopped working in or around coal mines on March 31, 2006, at the advice of his doctor. On September 28, 2006, Mr. McLean was approved for long-term disability. At that time, Dr. Merchant concluded that Mr. McLean was suffering from \u201csevere lung disease from a combination of tobacco use and coal mine dust exposures.\u201d Id. at 9. Dr. Merchant further concluded that Mr. McLean was \u201cseverely] impair[ed]\u201d and \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d Id. On October 1, 2008, Mr. McLean transferred from long-term disability to retirement.\nIn addition to his exposure to coal dust during his employment, two other factors potentially contributed to his COPD. First, Mr. McLean\u2019s childhood home lacked electricity and, therefore, \u201cfood was cooked on a wood or coal burning stove.\u201d Id. at 21. \u201cSuch an activity is associated with a very high risk for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .... \u201d Id. Second, Mr. McLean smoked for most of his adult life. More specifically, between the ages of twenty and sixty-four, he smoked approximately 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day. He ultimately quit smoking in May of 2008.\nProcedural background\na) The submission and initial processing of the claim\nOn September 7, 2010, Mr. McLean submitted a claim for benefits under the BLBA. Mr. McLean died on June 11, 2011, while his claim for benefits was pending. Mr. McLean\u2019s wife, Susan McLean, succeeded him as the claimant.\nThe DOL\u2019s \u201cDistrict Director approved the claim, because the evidence established the elements of entitlement that Mr.... McLean had [coal worker\u2019s pneumoconio-sis] and was totally disabled due to pneu-moconiosis.\u201d Id. at 242.\nOn July 21, 2011, Spring Creek requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). Consequently, the case was referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for a formal hearing. The case was assigned to a specific ALJ on June 27, 2013. On September 23, 2013, the ALJ held an evidentiary hearing in Denver, Colorado. Both Mrs. McLean and her son testified about Mr. McLean\u2019s experiences as a coal miner. Spring Creek presented its own witnesses who testified about the working conditions at the mine where Mr. McLean was employed.\nb) The ALJ\u2019s decision and order\nOn October 6, 2015, the ALJ issued a decision and order awarding benefits to Mrs. McLean under the BLBA. In doing so, the ALJ first found \u201cthat for at least 15 years of his coal-mine employment at Spring Creek ..,, Mr. McLean worked in dust conditions substantially similar to those found in underground mining.\u201d Id. at 247. The ALJ explained that \u201c[e]ven though' Mr. McLean worked inside a cab with an attached dust collector, he was regularly exposed to coal dust when he worked for Spring Creek.\u201d Id. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d the ALJ noted, \u201cMr. McLean\u2019s wife\u2019s and son\u2019s testimony of his daily appearance after work suggested] Mr. McLean was regularly exposed to dust.\u201d Id. As for the evidence submitted by Spring Creek regarding the dust exposure that Mr. McLean likely encountered during his employment, the ALJ concluded that it was \u201cinsufficient to show that Mr. McLean was not regularly exposed to coal mine dust.\u201d Id. The ALJ therefore concluded that \u201cthe first condition necessary to invoke the [applicable statutory and regulatory] presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis\u201d had been met. Id. The ALJ in turn noted that \u201c[t]he parties stipulated that [Mr. McLean] had a totally disabling pulmonary or respiratory impairment.\u201d Id. at 247-48. Thus, the ALJ concluded that Mrs. McLean \u201cha[d] established the applicability of the rebuttable presumption that [Mr. McLean] was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. at 248.\nTo rebut this presumption, the ALJ noted, Spring Creek was required to show either (1) that Mr. McLean \u201cdid not have any form of pneumoconiosis under the pertinent statutory and regulatory standards,\u201d i.e., that he did not suffer from either \u201cclinical pneumoconiosis\u201d or \u201clegal pneu-moconiosis,\u201d or (2) \u201cthat \u2018his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out Of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4)). Addressing the evidence in the record, the ALJ found \u201cthat the x-ray evidence-and Dr., [Peter] Tuteur\u2019s medical opinion established] that [Mr.' McLean] did not have clinical pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. at 251. And, \u201c[t]here being no evidence to the contrary,\u201d the ALJ \u201cf[ou]nd that [Spring Creek] ... disproved the existence of clinical pneumoconiosis pursuant to Section 718.805(d)(l)(i)(B).\u201d Id. As for legal pneumoconiosis, however, the ALJ found \u201cthat the medical opinion evidence [offered by Spring Creek][wa]s insufficient to .disprove the existence of legal pneumoconio-sis.\u201d Id. More specifically, the,ALJ found that \u201c[t]here [wa]s simply no well-reasoned, documented opinion, consistent with the regulatory standards and their scientific bases, establishing that [Mr. McLean] did not suffer from legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. at 258. Thus, the ALJ concluded that Spring Creek \u201cfailed to establish by a preponderance of the credible medical evidence that [Mr. McLean] d[id] not suffer from pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. at 259.\nThe ALJ in turn found that Spring Creek \u201cha[d] failed to rebut the presumption that [Mr. McLean] was totally disabled due to legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. Consequently, the ALJ concluded that Mrs. McLean \u201c[wa]s entitled to benefits under the Act.\u201d Id. at 260. Because it was unclear from the record when Mr. McLean \u201cbecame totally disabled due to pneumoco-niosis,\u201d the.ALJ ordered that \u201cbenefits sh[ould] commence from September 2010, the month in which [Mr. McLean] filed the claim.\u201d Id,\nc) The Board\u2019s decision and order \u25a0\nSpring Creek appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the DOL\u2019s Benefits Review Board (the Board). Spring Creek asserted two general arguments:. (1) that' the ALJ \u201cerred in finding that [Mr. McLean] established at least fifteen years of qualifying coal mine employment,\u201d and in turn erred in finding that Mr. McLean \u201cinvoked the Section 411(c)(4) presumption\u201d; and (2) that the ALJ \u201cerred in finding that [Spring Creek] did not rebut the presumption.\u201d Id. at 264. On February 16, 2017, the Board issued a written decision and order rejecting Spring Creek\u2019s arguments and affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision. In doing so, the Board first rejected Spring Creek\u2019s argument that the ALJ \u201capplied an incorrect standard\u201d in deciding to credit Mr; McLean \u201cwith at least fifteen years of qualifying coal mine employment.\u201d Id. at 267. The ALJ, the Board noted, \u201capplied the correct standard, requiring claimant to establish that [Mr. McLean\u2019s] surface coal mine employment regularly exposed him to coalmine dust.\u201d Id. The Board in turn rejected Spring Creek\u2019s argument that the ALJ \u201cerred in finding the evidence established that [Mr. McLean] was regularly exposed to coal-mine dust while working at his surface coal mine employment.\u201d Id. at 268. Thus, the Board in turn affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \u201cdetermination that claimant invoked the rebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis at Section 411(c)(4).\u201d Id. Finally, the Board rejected Spring Creek\u2019s argument that the ALJ \u201cerred in finding that [Spring Creek] failed to establish that [Mr. McLean] did not have legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. at 269. In doing so, the Board concluded that the ALJ \u201cpermissibly discredited the opinions of [Spring Creek\u2019s experts] Drs. [Robert] Farney and [Peter] Tuteur, the only opinions supportive of a finding that [Mr. McLean] did not suffer from legal pneumoco-niosis.\u201d Id. at 270. Accordingly, the Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and order awarding benefits to Mrs. McLean.\nII\nSpring Creek now petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision and order. \u201cOnce the Board makes a merits determination, th\u00e9 [BLBA] allows for only \u2018limited\u2019 judicial review to determine \u2018whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the ALJ and. whether the legal conclusions of the [Board] and ALJ are rational and consistent with applicable law.\u2019 \u201d Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Stallard, 876 F.3d 663, 668 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Hobet Mining, LLC v. Epling, 783 F.3d 498, 504 (4th Cir. 2015)), As a result, \u201cwe review the ALJ\u2019s factual findings for \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 ... and the Board\u2019s legal conclusions de novo.\u201d Id. Further, \u201cwe do not reweigh the evidence, but instead ask if, based on the record as a whole, substantial evidence is present to support the ALJ\u2019s decision,\u201d Antelope Coal Co./Rio Tinto Energy Am. v. Goodin, 743 F.3d 1331, 1341 (10th Cir. 2014). \u2018\u201c[T]he task of weighing conflicting medical evidence is within the sole province of the ALJ.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Hansen v. Dir., OWCP, 984 F.2d 364, 368 (10th Cir. 1993) (alteration in original) ).\na) The BLBA and its statutory and regulatory framework\nThe stated purpose of the BLBA is \u201cto provide benefits ... to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis [ (black lung disease) ] and to th\u00e9 surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a). Pneu-moconiosis, according to DOL regulations implementing the BLBA, is \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\" 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a). \u201cThis definition includes both medical, or \u2018clinical\u2019, pneumoconiosis and statutory, or \u2018legal\u2019, pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. Clinical pneumoconio-sis \u201cconsists of\u2019 a number of \u201cdiseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconiosis\u201d that are \u201ccharacterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine \u25a0 employment.\u201d Id, \u00a7 718.201(a)(1). Legal pneumoconiosis \u201cincludes any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d Id \u00a7 718.201(a)(2).\nTo establish entitlement to benefits under the BLBA, a claimant must demonstrate that: (1) he is a miner as defined in the applicable regulation; (2) he has pneu-moconiosis (either form); (3) the pneumo-coniosis arose out of coal mine employment; (4) he is totally disabled; and (5) the pneumoconiosis contributes to the total disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.202(d).\nThe BLBA adopts several presumptions that apply for purposes of determining whether a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and whether the death of a miner was due to pneumoconiosis. See 30 U.S.C., \u00a7 921 (c)(l)-(5). One of those presumptions, the fifteen-year presumption, is central to the outcome in this case and states:\n[I]f a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in one or more underground coal mines, and if there is a chest roentgenogram, submitted in connection with such miner\u2019s, his widow\u2019s, his child\u2019s, his parent's,-his brother\u2019s, his sister\u2019s, or his dependent\u2019s claim under this subchapter and it is interpreted as negative with respect to the requirements of paragraph (3) of this subsection, and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, that his death was due to pneumoconiosis, or that at the time of his. death' he was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis. In the case of a living miner, a wife\u2019s affidavit may not be used by itself to establish the presumption. The Secretary shall not apply all or a portion of the requirement of this paragraph that the miner work in an underground mine where he determines that conditions of a miner\u2019s employment in a coal mine other than an underground mine were substantially similar to conditions in an underground mine. The Secretary may rebut such presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not, or did not, have pneumoconiosis, or that (B) his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine.\n30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4).\nThe fifteen-year presumption outlined in \u00a7 921(c)(4) \u201cwas [first] created in 1972\u201d and later \u201crepealed in 1981.\u201d Consolidation Coal Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, 864 F.3d 1142, 1145 (10th Cir. 2017). \u201cIn 2010, however, Congress revived the presumption as to all claims filed after January 1, 2005, and pending on or after March 23,2010.\u201d Id.\nFollowing Congress\u2019s revival of the fifteen-year presumption, the DOL, at Congress\u2019s express direction, revised and adopted a regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305, providing further guidance on the implementation of the presumption. Subsection (b) of the regulation addresses when and how the statutory presumption may be invoked by a claimant and provides, in pertinent part:\n(1) The claimant may invoke the presumption by establishing that\u2014\n(1) The miner engaged in coal-mine employment for fifteen years, either in one or more underground coal mines, or in coal mines other than underground mines in conditions substantially similar to those in underground mines, or in any combination thereof; and\n(ii) The miner or survivor cannot establish entitlement under \u00a7 718.304 by means of chest x-ray evidence; and\n(iii) The miner has, or had at the time of his death, a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment established pursuant to \u00a7 718.204, except that \u00a7 718.204(d) does not apply.\n(2) The conditions in a mine other than an underground mine will be considered \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those in an underground mine if the claimant demonstrates that the miner was regularly exposed to coal-mine dust while working there.\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(b) (emphasis added).\nSubsection (d) of the regulation, entitled \u201cRebuttal,\u201d in turn acknowledges that a party opposing a miner\u2019s claim \u201cmay rebut the presumption\u201d and states, in pertinent part:\n(2) Survivor\u2019s claim. In a claim filed by a survivor, the party opposing entitlement may rebut the presumption by\u2014\n(i) Establishing both that the miner did not have:\n(A) Legal pneumoconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201(a)(2); and\n(B) Clinical pneumoconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201(a)(1), arising out of coal mine employment (see \u00a7 718.203); or\n(ii) Establishing that no part of the miner\u2019s death was caused by pneumoconio-sis as defined in \u00a7 718.201.\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(d)(2).\nb) Spring Creek\u2019s challenge to the regulation\nSpring Creek challenges the legitimacy of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(b)(2). According to Spring Creek, the \u201cregularly exposed to coal-mine dust\u201d standard adopted in that part of the regulation for assessing claims of above-ground coal miners, such as Mr. McLean, fails to satisfy the statutory standard that is outlined in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4), i.e., that \u201cconditions of a miner\u2019s employment in a coal mine other than an underground mine were substantially similar to conditions in an underground mine.\u201d Simply put, Spring Creek contends the regulation\u2019s \u201cregularly exposed to coalmine dust\u201d standard does not equate to the statute\u2019s standard which requires a showing of conditions \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those in an underground mine. Spring Creek argues that an above-ground mining position is not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to an underground mining position merely because a miner in an above-ground position is \u201cregularly\u201d exposed to coal mine dust. Aplt. Br. at 25. Indeed, Spring Creek argues, \u201c[a] \u2018regular exposure to dust\u2019 standard eliminates any inquiry into whether the quantity of dust exposure was \u2018substantially similar\u2019 or if the dust exposure essentially resembled underground mining without being identical.\u201d Id. Thus, Spring Creek argues, the DOL\u2019s \u201c\u00a7 718.305(b)(2) regulation provides a definition different from the statute by looking only for regular dust exposure to find work in conditions other than an underground mine sufficient to invoke the 15-year presumption.\u201d Id. at 26. Spring Creek also argues that, even though the regulation allows operators to introduce dust sampling and other information to attempt to rebut the presumption, the regulation provides \u201cno guidance\u201d as to \u201chow the introduction of such technical data is relevant or may be used in analyzing the \u2018inherently anecdotal\u2019 lay evidence\u201d that will inevitably be introduced by a claimant. Id. at 29.\nSpring Creek\u2019s arguments, however, are undercut by our prior decision in Antelope Coal. In that case, we dealt with a BLBA claim and, in doing so, had to decide as a threshold matter whether the revised versions of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.305(b)(2) and (d)(1) applied to the case since they became effective after the claim was filed. We held that the revised subsections did in fact \u201capply because they do not change existing law and are substantially consistent with prior regulations and agency practices.\u201d 743 F.3d at 1342. With respect to \u00a7 718.305(b)(2) in particular, we noted that it \u201caddresses when a surface miner\u2019s working conditions are substantially similar to underground mining working conditions.\u201d Id. Further, we noted that the Seventh Circuit was \u201c[t]he only circuit to address this issue\u201d and it \u201chas long held that surface miners do not need to provide evidence of underground mining conditions to compare with their own working conditions.\u201d Id. (citing decisions from the Seventh Circuit). \u201cThese [Seventh Circuit] decisions,\u201d we held, \u201cvalidate the [DOL] \u2019s longstanding position that consistently dusty working conditions are sufficiently similar to underground mining conditions.\u201d Id. And, \u2022 we held, \u201c[t]he revised regulation,\u201d i.e., \u00a7 718.305(b)(2), \u201ccodifies that interpreta-' tion by making regular exposure to coal mine dust the standard to determine substantial similarity of surface working conditions to those in underground mines.\u201d Id.\nSpring Creek acknowledges Antelope Coal in its opening, brief, but attempts to distinguish it as a factual matter. According to Spring Creek, Antelope Coal \u201cwas more tenuous that [sic] the Board suggests and driven by the facts presented.\u201d Aplt. Br, at 34. In particular, Spring Creek as-. serts that in Antelope Creek \u201cthere was no evidence to consider but for the miner\u2019s testimony about his exposure to dust at above-ground mines.\u201d Id Further, Spring Creek argues that \u201c[t]here was no \u00a7 718.305(b)(2) to consult at the time of [the] hearing\u201d in Antelope Creek \u201cas it was not published until September 25, 2013.\u201d Id. Lastly, Spring Creek asserts that in Antelope Creek \u201cthere was no, scientific information to measure similarity and guide the fact finder\u2019s analysis.\u201d Id. at 35.\nWe reject Spring Creek\u2019s arguments. To begin with, it is immaterial whether or not the employer in Antelope Creek presented evidence\u2014scientific or otherwise\u2014to rebut the miner\u2019s testimony. The important point,, for purposes of the instant appeal, is Antelope.Creek\u2019s discussion of the miner\u2019s burden that is outlined in \u00a7 718.305(b)(2). And, in turn, Spring Creek is-incorrect in suggesting that \u00a7 718.305(b)(2) was somehow inapplicable in Antelope Creek simply because it had not been published at the time of the October 20, 2010 evidentiary hearing before the ALJ. Indeed, the court in Antelope Creek expressly held that \u00a7\u2019 718.305(b)(2) was applicable to the miner\u2019s claim. 743 F.3d at'1341-42. Thus, contrary to Spring Creek\u2019s assertions, we conclude that Antelope Creek is directly on point and effectively rebuts Spring Creek\u2019s challenge to the standard outlined in \u00a7 718.305(b)(2).\nMoreover, Spring Creek\u2019s position is also undercut by the various Seventh Circuit decisions that we referred to in Antelope Coal. Most notably, in Dir., Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Midland Coal Co., 855 F.2d 509 (7th Cir. 1988), the Seventh Circuit addressed \u201cthe question whether a surface miner, in order to qualify for . the presumption of \u00a7 [921(c)(4) ], bears the burden of producing evidence of conditions prevailing in an underground mine.\u201d Id. at 511. In answering this question' in the negative, the Seventh Circuit analyzed the language of \u00a7 921(c)(4) and could \u201cdiscern no plain meaning .of [its] requirement of \u2018substan-' tial similarity.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u201cInstead,\u201d the Seventh Circuit stated, \u201cimmediately apparent is the fact that the [BLBA] does not specify whether a claimant must establish similarity to a particular underground mine, a hypothetical underground mine, the best, worst, or an average underground mine.\u201d Id. Turning to the legislative history of the BLBA, the Seventh Circuit found \u201cit somewhat ambiguous,\u201d but was \u201cpersuaded\u201d that it ,\u201cestablish[ed] that Congress, at the very least, was aware that underground mines are dusty and that exposure to coal dust causes pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. at 512. The Seventh Circuit in turn held that \u201c[tjhis supports the conclusion that Congress focused specifically on dust conditions in enacting the \u2018substantial similarity\u2019 provision.\u201d Id. Ultimately, the Seventh Circuit held that \u201cin order to qualify for the presumption of [\u00a7 921(c)(4) ], a surface miner must only establish that he was exposed to sufficient coal dust in his surface mine employment.\u201d Id. \u201cIt is then the function of the ALJ,\u201d the Seventh Circuit held, \u201cbased on his expertise and, we would expect, certain appropriate objective factors (such as whether the surface miner was employed near the tipple\u2014where conditions are apparently known to be very dusty\u2014 or further away from the tipple), to compare the surface mining conditions established by the evidence to conditions known to prevail in underground mines.\u201d Id. at 512-13 (footnote omitted).\nImportantly, the DOL expressly relied on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Midland Coal when it revised and adopted the current and reinstated version of \u00a7 718.305(b)(2) in 2013. In discussing the regulation, the DOL stated, in pertinent part:\nThe final rule\u2019s revised language clarifies the Department\u2019s intent about how the substantial similarity analysis should be conducted. The final rule acknowledges, as the Seventh Circuit recognized in Midland Coal, a fundamental premise underlying the BLBA, as demonstrated by the legislative history, i.e., that \u201cunderground mines are dusty.\u201d Midland Coal, 855 F.2d at 512. Given that legislative fact, it is unnecessary for a claimant to prove anything about dust conditions existing at an' underground mine for purposes of invoking the 15-year presumption. Instead, the claimant need only focus on developing evidence addressing the dust conditions prevailing at the non-underground mine or mines at which the min\u00e9r worked. The objective of this evidence is to show that the miner\u2019s duties regularly exposed him to coal mine' dust, and thus that the miner\u2019s work conditions approximated those at an underground mine. The term \u201cregularly\u201d has been added to clarify that a demonstration of sporadic or incidental exposure is not sufficient to meet the claimant\u2019s burden. The fact-finder simply' evaluates the. evidence presented, and determines whether it credibly, establishes that the \"miner\u2019s non-underground mine working conditions regularly exposed him to coal mine dust. If that fact is established to the fact-finder\u2019s satisfaction, the claimant has met his burden of showing substantial similarity. And if the\u2019periods of regular exposure in non-underground mine employment (combined with any underground mine employment) total 15 years or more, the claimant will be entitled to invoke the presumption if a total respiratory or pulmonary disability is also established. This procedure will also alleviate one commenter\u2019s concern that some administrative law judges may not be knowledgeable about conditions in underground mines.\nTo the extent the comments urge the Department to adopt technical comparability criteria, . such as requiring a claimant to produce scientific evidence specifically quantifying the miner\u2019s exposure to coal mine dust during non-underground mining, the Department rejects the suggestion. Benefit claimants, who must bear the burden of proving substantial similarity to invoke the presumption, generally do not control this type of technical information about the mines in which the miner worked. See generally Usery, 428 U.S. at 29, 96 S.Ct. 2882 (noting that \u201cshowing of the degree of dust concentration to which a miner was exposed [is] a historical fact difficult for the miner to prove.\u201d). Instead, the coal mine operators control dust-sampling and similar information about their mines. While this information is publicly available from the Mine Safety and Health Administration for some mines, it may not be relevant or available in any particular case. Dust sampling in non-underground mines is done on a designated-position basis (e.g., bulldozer operator, driller). See generally 30 CFR 71.201 et seq. Thus, the results may not be relevant to miners doing other jobs and certainly would not be an adequate basis for the Department to adopt an exposure rule for all non-underground miners.\nInstead, the Department believes the standard should be one that may be -satisfied by lay evidence addressing the individual miner\u2019s experiences. Congress enacted the Section 411(c)(4) presumption to assist miners and their survivors in establishing entitlement to benefits, and also permitted certain claimants to prove entitlement by lay evidence. 30 U.S.C. 923(b). Putting insurmountable hurdles in claimants\u2019 paths does not comport with that intent. Moreover, because a claimant\u2019s dust exposure evidence will be inherently anecdotal, it would serve no purpose for the Department to develop an objective, and therefore dissimilar, benchmark of underground mine conditions for comparison purposes. The legislative fact that underground coal mines are dusty is fully sufficient for this purpose. Of course, nothing would preclude a coal mine operator from introducing evidence\u2014including any technical data within its control\u2014showing that the particular miner was not regularly exposed to coal mine dust during his non-underground coal mine employment.\nRegulations Implementing the Byrd Amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act:' Determining Coal Miners\u2019 and Survivors\u2019 Entitlement to Benefits, 78 Fed. Reg. 59102, 59104-59105 (Sept. 25, 2013). As these comments make clear, the DOL clearly considered and rejected the same argument that Spring Creek is asserting in this case.\nOf course, we are not bound by the DOL\u2019s determination that its own regulation is consistent with the BLBA. But we must defer to the DOL\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the BLBA. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res, Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); Andersen v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, 455 F.3d 1102, 1103 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that courts must give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the DOL\u2019s interpretation of the BLBA). And the DOL\u2019s explanation reasonably and persuasively indicates why the standard adopted in \u00a7 718.305(b)(2) is consistent with \u00a7 921(c)(4)\u2019s \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d standard. Moreover, the DOL\u2019s explanation undercuts Spring Creek\u2019s argument on appeal that \u201c[a] \u2018regular exposure to dust\u2019 standard\" eliminates any inquiry into whether the quantity of dust exposure was \u2018substantially similar\u2019 or if the dust exposure essentially resembled underground mining without being identical.\u201d As the DOL notes, that is precisely what an ALJ must do in analyzing an above-ground miner\u2019s claim to the presumption, i.e., the ALJ must, based upon the evidence presented by the miner and the coal company, determine how much coal dust the miner was exposed to during his/her career and decide whether that exposure was substantially similar to what a miner would have been exposed to in an underground mine. Finally, and relatedly, it is simply unclear what Spring Creek would have an ALJ do in assessing an above-ground miner\u2019s claim. Really all that an ALJ can do is precisely what the DOL indicates they must do: \u201csimply evaluate[ ] the evidence presented, and determine!] whether it credibly establishes that the miner\u2019s non-underground mine working conditions regularly exposed him to coal mine dust.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. 59,105 (Sept. 25, 2013).\nThus, in sum, we reject Spring Creek\u2019s challenge to the legitimacy of \u00a7 718.305(b)(2).\nc) Did the ALJ err in his analysis of the medical opinions?\nSpring Creek also argues that the case must be remanded because the ALJ \u201cerr[ed] in his analysis of the medical opinions\u201d that were offered at the evidentiary hearing. Aplt. Br. at 45. In support, Spring Creek first asserts that \u201cif the 15-year presumption is inapplicable\u201d (as it argues in its first issue), \u201cthe ALJ must be instructed to reweigh the evidence for proof pneumoconiosis and [whether] pneumoco-niosis significantly caused disability rather than determining if the evidence disproves legal pneumoconiosis and disproves disability due to pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id. For the reasons outlined above, however, we conclude that the ALJ properly applied the 15-year presumption. Consequently, we reject Spring Creek\u2019s argument that the case must be remanded.\nAdditionally, Spring Creek argues that \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s use of the Preamble [to the DOL\u2019s regulations] is flawed.\u201d Id. \u201cThe Preamble,\u201d Spring Creek asserts, \u201cexplained why the [DOL] found coal mine dust can cause COPD in some instances\u201d and \u201cits purpose was not to establish that coal mine dust is the cause of all COPD in all coal miners.\u201d Id. at 45-46. Spring Creek in turn argues that \u201c[t]he Preamble, the regulations, and the case law, recognize that miners can have COPD that is not due to coal mine dust exposure.\u201d Id. at 46. Spring Creek argues that the ALJ in this case, however, essentially treated the \u201cPreamble standards\u201d as standing \u201cfor the proposition that any disabled miner with COPD has legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id at 52. \u201cSuch a reading of the regulation,\u201d Spring Creek argues, \u201cflies in the face of the definition of legal pneumoconiosis, as well as portions of the preamble.\u201d Id. Spring Creek also argues that the ALJ effectively fashioned, based upon the Preamble, \u201crule[s] of law that physicians are unable to use parameters of pulmonary function studies to determine disease causation\u201d and \u201cthat decrements in the FEVj /FYC ratio are always due to coal dust.\u201d Id. at 46 (emphasis in original).\nSpring Creek is mistaken. \u201cAs revised in 2000, the [DOL] regulations are preceded by an extensive Preamble that \u2018sets forth the medical and scientific premises relied on by the [DOL] in coming to [its medical] conclusions in [crafting] its regulations.\u2019 \u201d Westmoreland Coal, 876 F.3d at 667 (quoting Harman Mining Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, 678 F.3d 305, 314 (4th Cir. 2012)). These conclusions, which are \u201c[t]he product of notice-and-comment rulemaking,\u201d must be accorded \u201csubstantial deference\u201d by this court. Id Consequently, courts have \u201crepeatedly held that ALJs may look to the Preamble in weighing medical opinions addressing the cause of a claimant\u2019s disabling lung disease.\u201d Id.\nIn this case, the ALJ, after concluding that Mr. McLean was entitled to the statutory/regulatory presumption of pneumoco-niosis, in turn analyzed the medical evidence to determine whether Spring Creek had rebutted that presumption. The ALJ first concluded that, in- light of the. x-ray evidence in the record, there was no evidence that Mr. McLean suffered from clinical pneumoconiosis and thus \u201cf[ou]nd that [Spring Creek] ha[d] disproved the existence of clinical pneumoconiosis.\u201d Aplt. App. at 251. The ALJ then examined the \u201cmedical opinion evidence\u201d and concluded that it was \u201cinsufficient to disprove the existence of legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Id.\nIn reaching this conclusion,' the ALJ first noted that Dr. Eva Gottschall, who actually examined Mr. McLean for the DOL prior to Mr. McLean\u2019s death, \u201copined that [his] coal dust exposure during 29 years of employment in open pit coal mines in Wyoming and Montana and his 66 pack-year smoking history [we]re \u2018substantially contributing factors to his COPD/em-physema, resulting in lung function abnormalities and oxygen requirements.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 252. Dr. \u2022 Gottschall \u201cstated that above-ground strip mining was a \u2018substantial contributor\u2019 to the disabling impairment.\u201d Id. She \u201cdiagnosed legal pneumoconiosis based on Mr. McLean\u2019s smoking history and his coal mine dust exposure.\u201d Id. The ALJ concluded that Dr. Gottschall\u2019s conclusions and diagnosis were \u201csupported by the underlying data,\u201d \u201cwell-reasoned,\u201d and \u201centitled to full probative weight.\u201d Id.\nThe ALJ in turn rejected the opinions of Drs. Farney and Tuteur, both of whom were offered by Spring Creek. Dr. Farney, who did not .examine Mr. McLean and instead reviewed only the medical records, \u201cfound that Mr. McLean\u2019s chronic tobacco smoke exposure was the overwhelming cause of his emphysema and severe obstructive airway disease and that the.probability that coal dust had any etiologic role was miniscule.\u201d Id. at 253. -Dr. Farney stated in his, deposition \u201cthat Mr. McLean\u2019s COPD, due to emphysema, [wa]s one hundred-percent related to his tobacco smoke exposure and that it d[id] not have anything to do with coal-dust exposure.\u201d Id. at 254. Dr. Farney also \u201cstated that Mr. McLean\u2019s FEV1 levels would .not typically be associated with occupational exposure to coal mine dust as a surface miner.\u201d \u215b\nDr. Tuteur, who likewise did not examine Mr. McLean and instead reviewed only the medical records, \u201copined that Mr. McLean\u2019s respiratory disease was caused by chronic inhalation- of tobacco smoke, not coal mine dust.\u201d Id. at 255. Dr. Tuteur \u201ccited to studies discussing that exposure to coal mine dust is insignificant when considering the cause of an average of FEVt loss.\u201d Id. \u201cSince Mr. McLean was a cigarette smoking coal miner with advanced [COPD], dominantly emphysema, Dr. Tuteur concluded that the etiology of the COPD was chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke not coal mine dust.\u201d Id.\nThe ALJ concluded that \u201cthe opinions by Drs, Farney and Tuteur [we]re not consistent with the scientific evidence accepted by the [DOL].\u201d Id. at 256. The ALJ explained that \u201cthe prevailing view of the medical community as expressed by the [DOL] in the Preamble to its regulations is that the effects of cigarette smoke and coal dust on [COPD] and chronic bronchitis are additive\u201d and \u201cthat dust-induced emphysema and smoke-induced emphysema occur through similar mechanisms.\u201d Id. Also, the ALJ noted, the DOL \u201ccited with approval the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (\u2018NIOSH\u2019) findings \u2018that coal miners have an increased risk of developing COPD\u2019 and that \u2018COPD may be detected from decrements in certain measures of lung function, especially FEVi and the ratio of FEV/FVC.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 65 Fed. Reg. 79,943 (Dec. 20, 2000)). \u201cBoth Drs. Farney and Tuteur,\u201d the ALJ noted, \u201cexpressed views contrary to these positions.\u201d Id.\nThe ALJ also noted that \u201cDrs. Farney and Tuteur\u201d failed to \u201cexplain[ ] why coal mine dust could not have been a contributing or aggravating factor.\u201d Id. at 257. More specifically, the ALJ concluded that \u201cneither physician explained] or adequately supported] his opinion, that the Miner\u2019s coal mine dust exposure did not contribute to his respiratory disability, with the science. underlying the Preamble, which stands for the proposition that coal mine dust exposure, even in the absence of clinical pneumoconiosis, may contribute to an obstructive impairment reflected in a reduced FEVi FEV/FVC ratio.in an additive fashion with' smoking,\u201d Id. The ALJ in turn noted that \u201cunder the regulations, coal mine dust need only make a substantial or significant contribution to an impairment or condition for the condition to constitute legal pneumoconiosis, and it does not need to be the most significant cause or factor.\u201d Id, In Mr. McLean\u2019s case, the ALJ noted, Spring Creek\u2019s \u201cexperts have failed to explain why coal mine dust could not have= contributed to or substantially aggravated his condition, even if it was primarily due to cigarette smoking.\u201d Id.\nThus, in sum, the ALJ\u2019s findings and decision in this case were case-specific and confined to the specific flaws in the testimony of Drs. Farney and Tuteur, The ALJ 'did not, as Spring Creek argues in its appeal, interpret the Preamble standards as indicating \u201cthat any disabled miner with COPD has legal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 52. Instead, the ALJ simply recognized, as he was required to do by the Preamble, (1) \u201cthat the effects of cigarette smoke and coal dust on [COPD] and chronic, bronchitis are additive,\u201d (2) \u201cthat dust-induced emphysema and smokerinduced emphysema occur through similar mechanisms,\u201d (3) \u201cthat coal miners have an increased risk- of developing COPD,\u201d and (4) \u201cthat COPD may be detected from decrements in certain measures of lung function, especially FEVt and the ratio of FEV/FVC.\u201d Aplt. App. at 256 (internal quotations omitted). Nor did the ALJ, as Spring Creek now asserts, fashion new rules \u201cthat physicians are unable to use parameters df pulmonary function studies to determine disease causation\u201d or \u201cthat the Preamble posits that decrements in the FEV/FVC ratio are always due to coal dust.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 46 (emphasis-in original). Instead, the ALJ simply noted that neither Dr. Farney nor Dr. Tuteur explained why decrements in Mr. McLean\u2019s FEV/FVC ratio were caused solely by his smoking and not at all from his work-related exposure to coal -dust. In short, the ALJ, properly taking into account the medical conclusions adopted by the DOL in the Preamble (as he was required to do), simply and correctly pointed out the flaws in the opinions of Drs. Farney and Tuteur, i.e., their absolute failure to explain why coal dust exposure could not have contributed in some measure to Mr. McLean\u2019s COPD.\nSpring Creek criticizes the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the testimony from Dr. William Houser, who testified that Mr. McLean did suffer from legal pneumoconiosis. According to Spring Creek, Dr. Houser\u2019s ultimate conclusion should have been \u201cdiscredited]\u201d because it \u201cwas not consistent with the facts of this case.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 51. But Spring Creek mischaracterizes \u201cthe facts of this case\u201d in making that argument. In particular, Spring Creek asserts that Mr. McLean experienced \u201cminimal dust exposure.\u201d Id. But that is clearly contrary to the findings of the ALJ. Moreover, Spring Creek\u2019s arguments ignore the medical conclusions in the Preamble, particularly the conclusion that the effects of cigarette smoking and coal dust exposure are additive\u2014a conclusion that its own doctors effectively ignored.\nFinally, Spring Creek makes a passing reference to the ALJ \u201cconfus[ing] the disability causation definition with legal pneu-moconiosis and the burden incumbent to establish its absence with the \u2018rule out\u2019 standard for determining disability is due to coal dust exposure.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 52. But, contrary to Spring Creek\u2019s arguments, the ALJ did not require its physician-experts to \u201crule out\u201d the possibility that Mr. McLean\u2019s coal dust exposure contributed to his COPD. Instead, the ALJ simply took those physicians to task for failing to support their proffered opinions that that was the case. In other words, it was Drs. Far-ney and Tuteur who opined that coal dust exposure played no role in Mr. McLean\u2019s COPD, and the ALJ found those opinions lacking in evidentiary support. The ALJ\u2019s approach to this opinion evidence was not improper.\nThus, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in his analysis of the proffered medical opinions, and that there is no need to remand this case for further proceedings.\nIll\nThe petition for review is DENIED.\n. Shortly after Spring Creek filed its petition, the clerk of this court directed the parties to address the matter of this court\u2019s jurisdiction in light of the fact that Mr. McLean last worked at a coal mine in Montana. The parties unanimously assert, and we agree, that we have jurisdiction over Spring Creek's petition because, even though Mr. McLean\u2019s place of last exposure to coal mine dust was in Montana, he also was exposed to coal mine dust when he worked in Wyoming. See Consolidation Coal Co. v. Chubb, 741 F.2d 968, 970-71 (7th Cir. 1984) (holding that jurisdiction is proper in any jurisdiction where a coal miner was employed because pneumoconiosis \u201cis caused by extensive, extended exposure to coal dust, and it is impossible to say that any one exposure caused the disease.\u201d).\n. Spring Creek's witnesses reported that approximately twenty-three dust samples were taken at the driller position over a twenty-year period and that those samples showed the dust levels to be lower than the maximum limit established by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA),\n. As the ALJ noted, \" '[cjlinical pneumoconio-sis\u2019 consists of those diseases recognized, by the medical community as 'pneumoconiosis such as coal workers' pneumoconiosis or silicosis\u201d while \"[Ilegal pneumoconiosis is defined as \u2018any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. App. at 248 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2)).\n. Subsection 921(c)(3), which is referred to in subsection 921(c)(4), provides, in essence, that a miner suffering from a chronic dust disease of the lung shall be entitled to an irrebuttable presumption that he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if chest x-ray opacities indicate the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3); see Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 7, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976) (noting that \"pneumoconiosis is customarily classified as 'simple\u2019 or 'complicated' \u201d). In this case, it is undisputed that Mr. McLean had simple, rather than complicated, pneu-moconiosis.\n. In 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b), Congress expressly directed the Secretary to adopt regulations \"prescrib[ing] standards for determining ... whether a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and for determining whether the death of a miner was due to pneumoconi-osis.\u201d\n. Although the \"regulation went into effect on October 25, 2013, it applies to all claims covered by the statutory amendment.\u201d Consolidation Coal Co., 864 F.3d at 1145 (citation omitted).\n. The ALJ in this c\u00e1se also relied on Seventh Circuit case law in expressly noting: \"Courts have found that, for the \u00a7 718.305 presumption to be applicable to non-underground employment, a claimant carries the burden of establishing comparability of dust conditions to employment in an underground mine.\u201d Joint App. at 245 (citing Dir., OWCP v. Midland Coal Co., 855 F.2d 509, 512 (7th Cir. 1988)).",
