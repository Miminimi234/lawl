        "text": "Madsen, J.\n\u00b6 1 This case concerns whether the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) Disciplinary Board (Board) erred in declining to order sua sponte review under ELC 11.3(a) and (d) in a disciplinary matter in which attorney Bakary Fansu Conteh did not seek appeal of a hearing officer\u2019s decision recommending that Conteh be suspended from the practice of law for two years and pay restitution. We affirm.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 The WSBA\u2019s Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) charged Conteh by formal complaint in December 2013 with multiple (five) counts of violating the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) involving two different clients. See Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, & Hr\u2019g Officer\u2019s Recommendations (FFCLR) at 1-2. The alleged violations resulted in the possible deportation of one client for Conteh\u2019s failure to file a timely brief with the federal Board of Immigration Appeals. The second client, who was injured in an auto accident but was without fault, was unable to collect any insurance monies because Conteh\u2019s inaction resulted in the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n\u00b63 Conteh appeared pro se at a two-day disciplinary hearing before a hearings officer in January 2015. The hearings officer issued lengthy findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations on April 20, 2015. He found that Conteh\u2019s conduct violated several RPCs, he applied the presumptive sanction (suspension), and he considered aggravating factors (five) and mitigating circumstances (none). Determining that there was no basis to depart from the presumptive sanction, the hearings officer recommended suspension for two years and restitution to one of Conteh\u2019s injured clients. ODC then moved to amend the FFCLR, Conteh responded, and the hearings officer entered an order granting ODC\u2019s motion to amend on May 26, 2015.\n\u00b64 Conteh did not appeal the FFCLR to the Board. Because no appeal was filed, the FFCLR was distributed to the Board\u2019s members on July 6, 2015 to determine whether to grant sua sponte review. See ELC 11.2(b), 11.3(a). The Board considered the FFCLR and on July 10, 2015 entered a unanimous order declining sua sponte review and adopting the hearings officer\u2019s decision.\n\u00b65 On July 24, 2015, Conteh tried to file in this court a petition for review of the order of the Board filed July 10, 2015, but this court\u2019s clerk rejected the filing in an e-mail, noting that Conteh\u2019s appropriate avenue was to file a notice of appeal and pay the filing fee to the clerk of the Board. On August 6, 2015, Conteh submitted the filing fee and the same petition for review to the Board\u2019s clerk, identifying the document as a \u201cnotice of appeal.\u201d The Board\u2019s clerk issued a receipt for the filing fee and notice of appeal, stating that the clerk would forward the record and filing fee to this court within 30 days. This court received these items on September 10, 2015.\n\u00b66 In his notice of appeal, Conteh sought \u201creview of both the hearing officer\u2019s decision and Order granting ODC motion to amend and the Board\u2019s decision declining sua sponte review and adopting the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision and order.\u201d Pet. for Review of the Order of Bd. of WSBA filed July 10,2015 at 1 (Notice of Appeal). This prompted ODC to move to strike the Notice of Appeal; Conteh responded, and ODC replied. This court\u2019s clerk denied the motion to strike, ruling that the Board\u2019s July 10, 2015 order is an appealable decision under ELC 12.3(a). ODC moved to modify the clerk\u2019s letter ruling. This court ultimately considered the matter en banc and issued an order on January 22, 2016 that governs the present review in this matter. We ruled that the Board\u2019s July 10, 2015 order denying sua sponte review and adopting the hearings officer\u2019s decision is an appealable order (under ELC 12.3(a)), and we denied ODC\u2019s motion to modify in part, but limited the scope of Conteh\u2019s appeal (petition) to this court to the issue and the record at the time of the Board\u2019s July 10, 2015 decision. \u201cThe scope of the issue on appeal is limited to whether the Disciplinary Board erred by not finding that sua sponte review was required to \u2018prevent substantial injustice or to correct a clear error,\u2019 see ELC 11.3(d).\u201d Order, In re Conteh, No. 201,448-8, at 1 (Wash. Jan. 22, 2016). The order directed this court\u2019s clerk to set a briefing schedule, he did so, and the parties filed briefs accordingly.\n\u00b67 After all scheduled briefing was submitted, ODC filed a motion requesting that the case be decided without oral argument. Conteh opposed that motion and, after considering the matter en banc, this court granted the motion and subsequently considered this case without oral argument.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b68 While this court bears the ultimate responsibility for lawyer discipline in this state, it will, nevertheless, give great weight to the hearings officer\u2019s findings of fact. In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Vanderveen, 166 Wn.2d 594, 604, 211 P.3d 1008 (2009). \u201cThis court will not disturb findings of fact made on conflicting evidence, and it will uphold findings of fact that are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Id.\n\u00b69 \u201cThe court reviews conclusions of law de novo, and it will uphold those conclusions if they are supported by the findings of fact.\u201d Id. This court also reviews sanction recommendations de novo, but will generally affirm the Board\u2019s sanction recommendation unless the court can articulate a specific reason to reject it. Id. As in other review proceedings, a hearings officer\u2019s unchallenged findings of fact are treated as verities on appeal. In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Marshall, 167 Wn.2d 51, 66, 217 P.3d 291 (2009). Further, the burden is on the attorney facing discipline to demonstrate how the sanction imposed is disproportionate or otherwise in error. See Vanderveen, 166 Wn.2d at 616. Also, this court generally defers to the Board regarding a sanction the Board imposes in light of the Board\u2019s expertise in disciplinary matters and particularly when the Board\u2019s decision is unanimous. Id.\n\u00b610 As noted, the only issue before this court is whether the Board sustainably declined sua sponte review, and the only record before this court is the hearings officer\u2019s FFCLR. As a threshold matter, Conteh\u2019s briefing wholly fails to address the present issue\u2014the propriety of the Board\u2019s order declining sua sponte review. Instead, Conteh\u2019s opening brief asks this court to \u201corder . . . the production of the full record to enable him to proof [sic] that sua sponte review was justified.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Opening Br. at 5. This court already addressed that issue, ruling that the record for present purposes is the same record before the Board when it decided to decline sua sponte review, namely the hearings officer\u2019s FFCLR. See Order at 1. As noted, no appeal was filed in this case following the hearings officer\u2019s decision. There is no automatic review of the hearings officer\u2019s decision. See ELC 11.2(b)(1). Conteh had 30 days to file an appeal of the hearings officer\u2019s decision to the Board. Id. He failed to do so. That was Conteh\u2019s opportunity to challenge the hearings officer\u2019s findings by specifically assigning error to any findings with which he disagreed. He did not do so, and the hearings officer\u2019s unchallenged findings are verities in the present matter. Marshall, 167 Wn.2d at 66.\n\u00b611 In his opening brief, Conteh cites to only one case as authority. He cites In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against McMullen, 127 Wn.2d 150, 896 P.2d 1281 (1995), for the proposition that this court reviews the entire record consistent with its ultimate responsibility over lawyer discipline matters. See Resp\u2019t\u2019s Opening Br. at 1 (citing McMullen, 127 Wn.2d at 162). But McMullen does not support the notion that this court is required to review the entire record in all disciplinary cases. In fact, while McMullen acknowledges generally that \u201cthe ultimate responsibility and authority for determining the nature of attorney discipline rests with this court,\u201d McMullen reiterated that \u201c[t]his court will adopt the recommended sanction of the board unless it can articulate a specific reason to depart from the board\u2019s recommendation.\u201d 127 Wn.2d at 162; see also In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Conteh, 175 Wn.2d 134, 149, 284 P.3d 724 (2012) (this court generally defers to the Board\u2019s expertise and affirms its sanction recommendations unless this court can articulate a specific reason to reject the recommendations); In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Day, 162 Wn.2d 527, 542, 173 P.3d 915 (2007) (same); In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Guarnero, 152 Wn.2d 51, 59, 93 P.3d 166 (2004) (same); In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against McLeod, 104 Wn.2d 859, 865, 711 P.2d 310 (1985) (same).\n\u00b612 As noted, in declining sua sponte review, the Board adopted the hearings officer\u2019s decision, as directed by ELC 11.3(a). Relevant here, this court also defers to the hearings officer\u2019s findings involving credibility assessments. Conteh, 175 Wn.2d at 147. Here, the hearings officer expressly found Conteh\u2019s explanations concerning his failings and conduct as to the two clients at issue were \u201cnot credible.\u201d FFCLR at 6 (Finding (B)(36)), 7 (Finding (B)(43)), 10 (Finding (C)(21)). Further, RAP 10.3(g) requires that \u201c[a] separate assignment of error for each finding of fact a party contends was improperly made must be included with reference to the finding by number.\u201d See also Conteh, 175 Wn.2d at 143-44. This court has waived this requirement under circumstances in which a party challenging a disciplinary determination has failed to make specific assignments of error but, nevertheless, clearly referred to each challenged finding by number in separate headings and paragraphs in the body of the party\u2019s brief. Id. But here, Conteh makes no specific assignments of error and fails to identify any findings he disagrees with in his briefing. Accordingly, the hearings officer\u2019s findings are unchallenged and are verities on appeal.\n\u00b613 More to the point, Conteh fails to meet his burden of showing how the Board\u2019s decision is in error. Conteh admits that he \u201ccannot articulate ... any ... factual error or wrong legal conclusions drawn from such fact[s].\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Opening Br. at 5. Here, no error is apparent. As noted above, the Board complied with the directives of ELC 11.3(a), which provides in relevant part:\nIf neither the Respondent nor Disciplinary Counsel files a timely notice of appeal from a Decision recommending suspension or disbarment, the Decision shall be distributed to the Board members for consideration of whether to order sua sponte review and the matter shall be scheduled for consideration by the Board. The Decision shall be distributed to the Board within 30 days after the last day to file a notice of appeal. .. .If the Board declines to order sua sponte review, the Board shall issue an order declining sua sponte review and adopting the Decision of the hearing officer.\n(Emphasis added.) As to the criteria for granting sua sponte review, ELC 11.3(d) directs, \u201cThe Board should order sua sponte review only in extraordinary circumstances to prevent substantial injustice or to correct a clear error.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As noted, Conteh\u2019s briefing requests only that this court order \u201cproduction of the full record\u201d so he can prove that sua sponte review was justified. Resp\u2019t\u2019s Opening Br. at 5. He identifies no extraordinary circumstances, no clear error, and no substantial injustice. Under these circumstances, we affirm the Board\u2019s order, which declined sua sponte review and adopted the hearings officer\u2019s decision as directed in ELC 11.3(a).\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b614 The Board did not abuse its discretion when it declined to order sua sponte review. Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s July 10, 2015 order, suspend Conteh for two years, and order that he pay restitution of $11,324.41, as set forth in the hearings officer\u2019s decision and unanimously adopted by the Board.\nFairhurst, C.J., and Johnson, Owens, Stephens, Wiggins, Gonz\u00e1lez, Gordon McCloud, and Yu, JJ., concur.\nELC 11.3 provides, in part:\n(a) Sua Sponte Review of Recommendations for Disbarment and Suspension. If neither the Respondent nor Disciplinary Counsel files a timely notice of appeal from a Decision recommending suspension or disbarment, the Decision shall be distributed to the Board members for consideration of whether to order sua sponte review and the matter shall be scheduled for consideration by the Board. The Decision shall be distributed to the Board within 30 days after the last day to file a notice of appeal. An order for sua sponte review shall set forth the issues to be reviewed. If the Board declines to order sua sponte review, the Board shall issue an order declining sua sponte review and adopting the Decision of the hearing officer.\n(d) Standards for Ordering Sua Sponte Review. The Board should order sua sponte review only in extraordinary circumstances to prevent substantial injustice or to correct a clear error.\n(Boldface omitted.)\nAs explained later, the record in the present matter is limited to the hearings officer\u2019s FFCLR.\nThe hearings officer found that Conteh violated RPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. Relevant portions of those rules are summarized as follows:\nRPC 1.1 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client,\u201d including \u201cthe legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d\nRPC 1.3 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d\nRPC 1.4(a)(3) and (b) provide in part that \u201c[a] lawyer shall . . . keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter . . . [and] shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d\nRPC 1.5(b) and (c)(1) provide in part that \u201c[t]he scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing,\u201d and that \u201c[a] contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing signed by the client.\u201d\nApplying these rules, the hearings officer determined that in the immigration matter, Conteh\u2019s failure to timely file an appeal brief and failure to appropriately file a motion to accept a late-filed brief violated RPC 1.1 (competence) and 1.3 (diligence) and, by failing to inform his client of these circumstances, Conteh\u2019s conduct violated RPC 1.4 (communication). The hearings officer determined that in the auto accident matter, Conteh failed to communicate with his client regarding fee arrangements or to put the contingent fee in writing, in violation of RPC 1.5(b) (basis of fee) and (c)(1) (contingent fee shall be in writing). Further, the hearings officer determined that Conteh\u2019s failure to attempt to settle or to file suit in his client\u2019s personal injury claim within the applicable statute of limitation period violated RPC 1.1 (competence) and 1.3 (diligence), and that Conteh\u2019s failure to inform the client regarding the status of his claim violated RPC 1.4 (communication).\nThe aggravating factors included (1) multiple prior disciplinary offenses, (2) dishonest or selfish motive, (3) pattern of misconduct, (4) multiple current offenses, and (5) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct.\nThe hearings officer recommended that Conteh be ordered to pay the client injured in the auto accident $11,324.41, reflecting the client\u2019s unpaid medical bills, and that Conteh\u2019s future reinstatement be conditioned on such restitution payment.\nThe revision clarified that Conteh\u2019s fee arrangement with the auto accident client was \u201ccontingent\u201d on the outcome of the matter and that the \u201c \u2018dishonest or selfish motive\u2019 \u201d aggravator applied. Order Granting Office of Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s Mot. to Amend Hr\u2019g Officer\u2019s Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law at 1-2. The changes did not alter the hearings officer\u2019s disciplinary recommendation.\nELC 11.2(b) provides that the Board will review a decision if \u201ceither party files a notice of appeal within 30 days of service of the Decision on the respondent\u201d or \u201cthe Board orders sua sponte review under rule 11.3.\u201d\nELC 12.3(a) provides that \u201c[t]he respondent lawyer or disciplinary counsel has the right to appeal a Board decision recommending suspension or disbarment. There is no other right of appeal.\u201d\nNotably, Conteh\u2019s reply brief (filed May 27, 2016) argued only that ODC\u2019s May 9,2016 response should be stricken as untimely. ODC filed an answer, noting that Conteh\u2019s reply was really a motion to strike and explaining why ODC\u2019s response was timely. This court\u2019s acting clerk agreed that Conteh\u2019s filing was a motion to strike. The acting clerk denied the motion to strike ODC\u2019s response brief. Conteh did not move to modify that ruling.\nELC 11.2 was amended in 2013 to replace the Board\u2019s automatic review of hearing examiners\u2019 suspension and disbarment recommendations with \u201c \u2018an appeal-driven system.\u2019 \u201d 2 Karl B. Tegland, Washington Practice: Rules Practice, ELC 1.1 author\u2019s cmt. 3, at 585 (8th ed. 2014) (quoting drafters\u2019 cmt. to ELC, 2013 rev.); see also id. ELC 11.2 author\u2019s cmt. 2, at 744.\nConteh cites to no case law in his reply.\nCf. In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Pfefer, 182 Wn.2d 716, 344 P.3d 1200 (2015). Therein, in the underlying personal injury action, an attorney failed to diligently pursue his client\u2019s claim (resulting in the claim being time barred), failed to convey a settlement offer to his client, and improperly withdrew from representation. In the subsequent disciplinary matter, we affirmed a unanimous recommendation by the Board to suspend the attorney from the practice of law for six months and to condition the attorney\u2019s reinstatement on his payment of restitution to his former client. See id. at 721, 733. In the present matter, the Board\u2019s unanimously recommended sanctions as described above are similarly appropriate, particularly given the multiple aggravating circumstances present in Conteh\u2019s case.
