    "head_matter": "Julius Hart, Appellant, v. The Direct United States Cable Company (Limited), Respondent.\n(Argued October 13, 1881;\ndecided October 25, 1881.)\nThis action was brought to recover damages for alleged negligence.\nIt appeared that one Hertz at Stuttgart had in his possession twenty-three \u201cCentral Pacific Joaquin Branch'bonds \u201d belonging to plaintiff. In November, 1875, Hertz telegraphed to plaintiff as follows: \u201c Joaquin unsalable, sell the twenty-three, or what ? Answer.\u201d Plaintiff delivered to defendant the following message in reply : \u201c Unsalable account Missouri, Pacific troubles, Hatch says hold undoubted.\u201d The message as delivered read \u201cUnsalable account Missouri, pacific troubles, Hatch says sold undoubled.\u201d \u2022 Hertz, interpreting this as an order to sell, sold the bonds at a loss, .to recover which this action was brought. Held, that plaintiff was properly non-suited ; that the negligence of defendant was not the cause of the loss, as the message delivered was an unintelligible jargon, and plaintiff\u2019s agent in treating it as an order to sell took the risk of the interpretation.\nEdwin, M. Felt for appellant.\nLewis J. Delafield for respondent."
