        "text": "Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge RANDOLPH.\nRANDOLPH, Senior Circuit Judge:\nIn August 2012, the Postal Regulatory Commission issued an order approving a negotiated service agreement for the sale of postage between the United States Postal Service and Valassis Direct Mail, Inc., a national marketing company. Under the agreement, Valassis receives discounted postage for some of its advertisement mailers once its mail volume hits a predetermined threshold. Petitioner Newspaper Association of America, with the support of three intervenors, challenges the Commission\u2019s order approving the deal.\nI\nThe Postal Service is empowered to set \u201creasonable and equitable\u201d postal \u201crates\u201d subject to the approval of the Postal Regulatory Commission. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 404(b), 3622(a), (d)(1). \u201cRates\u201d include not only those for the familiar first-class and priority mail, but also \u201cnegotiated service agreements,\u201d that is, contracts between the Postal Service and individual mailers for customized \u2014 and generally discounted \u2014 rates of postage. See 39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 S001.5(r), 3010.6.\nThe statutory system governing rates depends on whether the rate is for a \u201cmarket-dominant\u201d or a \u201ccompetitive\u201d service. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3642(b). A service is \u201cmarket-dominant\u201d if either (1) the Postal Service has achieved a level of market power in providing that service that would allow it to raise prices without losing \u201ca significant level of business,\u201d id. \u00a7 3642(b)(1), or (2) it is a service covered by the statutory postal monopoly, id. \u00a7 3642(b)(2). Because the negotiated service agreement in this ease is for the purchase of standard mail products, it is subject to the postal monopoly, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1696(a); 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.2(a), and thus the rules governing rates for market-dominant products apply.\nIn reviewing rates for market-dominant products, the Commission must consider the statutory factors set out in 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622(c). That subsection establishes rate- requirements for all market-dominant products, see id. \u00a7 3622(c)(1)-(9) & (11)-(14), as well as particular requirements for negotiated agreements, see id. \u00a7 3622(c)(10).\nAs relevant here, a negotiated service agreement must meet the following requirements: (1) it must improve the net financial position of the Postal Service, id. \u00a7 3622(c) (10) (A) (i); (2) it may not cause \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace,\u201d id. \u00a7 3622(c)(10)(B); (3) it must be \u201cavailable on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers,\u201d id. \u00a7 3622(c)(10); (4) it must comport with \u201cthe policies of [Title 39],\u201d id.; and (5) the Commission, before approving the agreement, must give \u201cdue regard\u201d to its impact on \u201csmall business concerns,\u201d id. \u00a7 3642(b)(3)(C).\n. Once,the Postal Service has negotiated terms with a particular mailer, it must notify the public and the Commission of its intention to implement a rate adjustment. 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3010.41. The Commission then initiates proceedings to determine whether the agreement complies with the statutory requirements. Id. \u00a7 3010.44. Comments from the Postal Service, its partner in the deal, and the public are welcome. See id. If the agreement is lawful, the Commission issues an order and the agreement may take effect. Id.\nThe Postal Service proposed the negotiated service agreement in this case- in April 2012, and the public proceeding commenced that May. The structure of the Agreement is fairly simple. For three years, Valassis agrees to maintain its current levels of \u201cstandard mail saturation flats\u201d \u2014 that is, advertising circulars delivered to at least 75 percent of potential addresses on a standard mail carrier route. In return, the Postal Service offers Valas-sis a discount on new mailing programs of that same type initiated in excess of current levels. The discount is limited in a few ways. It applies only to mailings carrying advertisements for retailers that deal in durable and semi-durable goods and that have a physical retail presence in 30 or more states. It also applies only to new mailing programs initiated in markets in which Valassis has an existing program. And the discount on that new program remains in force only if the corresponding existing program continues to operate at or above current levels.\nThe Commission received dozens of submissions from, among others, individual newspapers, two U.S. Senators, petitioner Newspaper Association of America, inter-venor National Newspaper Association, and intervenors Valpak Direct Marketing Systems and Valpak Dealers Association (collectively, \u201cValpak\u201d). The comments were overwhelmingly against the Agreement and, taken together, argued that the Agreement failed to satisfy any of the statutory criteria discussed above. The Commission disagreed and issued its final order approving the Agreement on August 23, 2012. It denied a motion to stay the order one week later. This petition for judicial review followed.\nII\nIntervenors Valpak and the National Newspaper Association argue that the Agreement was not properly before the Commission because the Governors of the Postal Service never approved it. This, they say, rendered the Commission\u2019s order void.\nEstablishing new rates, which includes proposing negotiated service agreements, is the job of the Governors of the Postal Service. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b). The Governors are appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and constitute nine of the eleven members of the \u201cBoard of Governors.\u201d Id. \u00a7 202. The Board of Governors comprises the nine Governors plus the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General. And the two bodies \u2014 the nine Governors as distinguished from the full Board \u2014 have independent statutory responsibilities. While the Board exercises the general \u201cpower of the Postal Service,\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a)(1), only the Governors are specifically authorized to \u201cestablish ... equitable rates of postage.\u201d Id. \u00a7 404(b).\n\u201cExcept for those powers, duties, or obligations specifically vested in the Governors, as distinguished from the Board of Governors, the Board may delegate the authority vested in it....\u201d Id. \u00a7 402. In other words, while the Board may delegate its duties, the Governors may not. And since \u201crates of postage\u201d includes negotiated service agreements, \u00a7 402 means that the Governors cannot delegate the job of executing such agreements and bringing them before the Commission \u2014 which is what the intervenors claim the Governors did here.\nThe intervenors\u2019 claim rests on the Governors\u2019 Resolution 11-4, signed in March 2011. The Resolution authorizes Postal Service \u201cmanagement\u201d to negotiate service agreements with postal customers and propose those agreements to the Postal Regulatory Commission. The Resolution declares all rates proposed under it \u201chereby established\u201d in advance, provided the rates comply with the statutory requirements-&emdash;\u2022 and the Resolution instructs the Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer to ensure that they do. Furthermore, it instructs management to provide the Governors with quarterly \u201creport[s]\u201d on new initiatives and to \u201cfurnish ... information ... regarding any significant, new program, policy, major modification, or initiative.\u201d On its face the Resolution does not seem to require the Governors to approve each new rate.\nIn April 2012, citing Resolution 11-4, Postal Service management submitted the Agreement to the Postal Regulatory Commission. In response, Valpak submitted comments to the Commission arguing that the Agreement was the result of an unlawful delegation by the Governors. It claimed that Resolution 11-4, by allowing Postal Service management to negotiate service agreements, delegates the Governors\u2019 statutory responsibility to set rates in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 402. Thus, according to Valpak, the Agreement was not properly before the Commission. The Postal Service replied that, notwithstanding Resolution 11-4, the Governors had in fact approved the Agreement before it was submitted. In this court, the intervenors once again raised the argument challenging Resolution 11&emdash;4, and the Postal Service reasserted that the Agreement had been pre-approved.\nThere is no reason for us to decide whether Resolution 11-4 unlawfully delegates authority to the Postal Service. According to the Postal Service, the Governors in fact reviewed and approved the Agreement before it was submitted to the Commission. That assertion was not challenged in the administrative proceeding, and we understand the Commission to have accepted it as fact. The intervenors challenge it for the first time in their reply brief to this court, but we have repeatedly held that we do not consider arguments raised only in a reply brief. See Rollins Envtl. Servs. (NJ), Inc. v. EPA, 937 F.2d 649, 652 n. 2 (D.C.Cir.1991); McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharms., Inc., 800 F.2d 1208, 1210-11 (D.C.Cir.1986). We thus accept the Postal Service\u2019s assertion as true.\nAt oral argument, counsel for interve-nors questioned whether pre-approval by the Governors was even enough-;\u00a7 402, counsel suggested, requires a more \u201cformal\u201d approval. But this argument, made at that point for the first time, comes much too late. See United States v. Southerland, 486 F.3d 1355, 1360 (D.C.Cir.2007). We therefore assume that the Governors\u2019 level of involvement in this case \u2014 approving the deal, if not actually submitting the paperwork \u2014 satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 402. As a result, we need not consider whether Resolution 11-4 violates \u00a7 402. See Fried v. Hinson, 78 F.3d 688, 692 (D.C.Cir.1996).\nWe now proceed to the merits of the order.\nIll\nIn approving the Agreement, the Commission concluded that the Agreement would not cause \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace.\u201d See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622(e)(10)(B). To do so, the Commission first had to interpret that statutory phrase. Typically, an administrative agency is entitled to a degree of deference in interpreting \u201cthe statute which it administers.\u201d Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 5.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). But petitioner Newspaper Association of America argues that the meaning of \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d had been settled before Congress codified the standard in the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, Pub. L. No. 109-435 \u00a7 201, 120 Stat. 3198, that when Congress enacted the statute using this language it adopted the earlier interpretation, and that the Commission was not free to depart from that interpretation.\nTo be more specific, before passage of the 2006 Act the Postal Rate Commission \u2014 the current Commission\u2019s predecessor \u2014 promulgated regulations governing negotiated service agreements. See Negotiated Service Agreements, 69 Fed.Reg. 7574 (Feb. 18, 2004) (codified at 39 C.F.R. subpt. L, later removed as obsolete). One of the regulations provided that negotiated service agreements were acceptable so long as they were \u201cconsistent with statutory criteria,\u201d \u201cbenefit[ted] the Postal Service,\u201d and did not cause \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace.\u201d 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3001.190(b) (2004). Another regulation required \u201can analysis of the impact\u201d of such an agreement on competitors of the parties to the agreement. Id. \u00a7 3001.193(f)(1)(i). According to the Newspapers, the Postal Rate Commission understood \u00a7 3001.193(f)(1)(i)\u2019s impact-analysis requirement to give content to \u00a7 3001.190(b)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d standard. It follows, the Newspapers say, that Congress incorporated the definition of \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d in the 2006 Act as the regulations and decisions of the Postal Rate Commission had interpreted the phrase.\nThe argument cannot survive close inspection. Its premise is incorrect. There is no reason to suppose, that the Postal Rate Commission thought \u00a7 3001.193(f)(1)(i)\u2019s direction to consider harm to competitors embodied a definition of \u00a7 3001.190(b)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace.\u201d Federal regulations, like federal statutes, may contain one provision that is meant to give more content to another. For instance, 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3010.1, entitled \u201cDefinitions in this sub-part,\u201d gives meaning to terms used in the postal regulations using .the unmistakable language, \u201cAnnual limitation means.... \u201d 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3010.1(a); see also, e.g., 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2 (\u201cDefinitions\u201d); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.1-1 (\u201cDefinitions\u201d). So when other regulations refer to \u201cthe annual limitation,\u201d \u00a7 3010.1(a)\u2019s definition clearly applies. See, e.g., 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3010.4(a). Sections 3001.190(b) and 3001.193(f)(1)(i) were not of that sort. They simply coexisted, sections apart. And at the end of the day, Congress codified but one of them.\nPostal Rate Commission precedents likewise contain nothing to indicate that \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d had become infused with the meaning the Newspapers detect. Early decisions of the Postal Rate Commission considered harm to competitors \u2014 \u00a7 3001-.193(f)(l)(i) had required as much. But the Postal Rate Commission did not tie that inquiry to the \u201cunreasonable harm\u201d standard. See, e.g., HSBC N. Am. Holdings Inc., Dkt. MC2005-2, at 37 (Postal Rate Comm\u2019n May 20, 2005) (op. and recommended decision), available at http://www. prc.gov/Docs/44/44289/OpinionMC2005-2 Finahpdf; Bank One Corp., Dkt. MC2004-3, at 17 (Postal Rate Comm\u2019n Apr. 21, 2006) (op. and recommended decision), available at http://www.prc.gov/Docs/48/ 48385/DeeisionMC2004-3Final.pdf. The current Commission\u2019s other post-Act negotiated service agreement proceeding considered the newly codified \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d factor but provided no content to it because there was no dispute about its meaning. See Discover Fin. Servs,, Dkt. MC2011-19, at 21 (Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n Mar. 15, 2011) (order), available at http://www.prc.gov/Docs/72/ 72262/Order_N o_694.pdf.\nIn this case the Commission was thus interpreting \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d for the first time. And because \u201cunreasonable\u201d is an amorphous term, we must give the nod to the agency in determining its meaning, so long as that meaning is rational and one the statutory language can bear. See, e.g., Capital Network Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 28 F.3d 201, 204 (D.C.Cir.1994). That test is satisfied here.\nThe Commission looked to antitrust law and concluded that harm to the marketplace was \u201cunreasonable\u201d only if it was the result of anticompetitive pricing \u2014 that is, pricing below cost. The Commission decided further that it was not obligated to protect individual competitors of the parties to the Agreement from the harms of fair competition. To the Commission, \u201cas long as the Postal Service is not pricing its products below costs to drive its competitors out of the business, it is not creating an unreasonable level of harm in the marketplace.\u201d Valassis Direct Mail, Inc., Dkt. MC2012-14, at 27 (Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n Aug. 23, 2012) (order) [hereinafter \u201cValassis Order\u201d], available at http:// www.prc.gov/Docs/85/85014/Order_No_ 1448.pdf. Since the terms of the Agreement price all postage above cost, the Commission did not find the rates to be anticompetitive and therefore concluded that the Agreement was not unreasonably harmful to the marketplace.\nIn giving content to ambiguous statutory phrases, an administrative agency is at liberty to look to other bodies of law, such as antitrust. See N. Natural Gas Co. v. Fed. Power Comm\u2019n, 399 F.2d 953, 961 (D.C.Cir.1968). Here, the Commission drew on a basic tenet of antitrust law: fair competition is good for consumers even when it leads to \u201cinjury inflicted upon rivals.\u201d RobeRt H. BoRk, The Antitrust Paradox 136-44 (1978). The Newspapers say the Commission\u2019s antitrust analysis was \u201ccramped.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. 35. They correctly remind us that, generally speaking, predatory pricing is just one of many ways to cause harm in a marketplace. But here it was precisely the \u201caggressive price reductions\u201d for Valassis that the Newspapers found objectionable. Opp\u2019n of Newspaper Ass\u2019n of Am., Valassis NSA, Dkt. MC2012-14, at 3 (Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n May 23, 2012). It was sensible for the Commission to address itself to potential anticompetitive harms risked by that specific aspect of the deal. The question whether \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d under \u00a7 3622(c)(10)(B) encompasses other anticompetitive tactics is not now before us.\nIn any event, in looking to the antitrust laws to inform its own statutory interpretation, the Commission is not \u201cstrictly bound by the dictates of th[o]se laws.\u201d N. Natural Gas Co., 399 F.2d at 961. Rather, the nature of the agency\u2019s interpretive discretion is that it may employ those concepts \u201cto a greater or lesser degree\u201d in order to set sound policy. Id.\nAgency policy judgments still must be adequately explained. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42-43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). On that score, the Newspapers argue that the Commission\u2019s application of the \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d standard was arbitrary and capricious.\nThey cite Professor John Panzar, an economist who, in prepared testimony in 2003, advised the old Postal Rate Commission on how to regulate negotiated service agreements. Professor Panzar believed that the concerns of \u201c[cjompetitors of the Postal Service\u201d should not be considered in evaluating a negotiated service agreement, so long as the Postal Service\u2019s pricing was not anticompetitive. Official Transcript of Postal Rate Commission at 1637, Capital One Servs., Inc., Dkt. MC2002-2 (Feb. 7, 2003), available at http://www.prc.gov/ Docs/37/37064/08-02-0703.pdf. But Professor Panzar also advised that \u201c[cjompetitors of the firm receiving the [negotiated service agreement] ... may be adversely affected\u201d and that \u201ctheir concerns are an important part of the evaluation process.\u201d Id. at 1595 (emphasis added). The Commission cited Professor Panzar in its analysis of the term \u201cunreasonable harm to the marketplace\u201d but declined to analyze the Agreement\u2019s effects on anyone other than the Postal Service\u2019s competitors. The Newspapers challenge what they perceive as a misguided application of Professor Panzar\u2019s approach.\nThe Newspapers are correct that the Commission did not meaningfully consider the impact the Agreement would have on Yalassis\u2019s competitors. But we do not believe this diversion from Professor Panzar was arbitrary and capricious. The Commission derived its primary rationale for interpreting \u201cunreasonable harm\u201d from antitrust law. It said as much and cited two Supreme Court cases for support. See Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 458, 113 S.Ct. 884, 122 L.Ed.2d 247 (1993) (\u201cThe [antitrust] law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.\u201d); Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 344, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962) (\u201cIt is competition, not competitors, which the [Sherman] Act protects.\u201d). On that basis, the Commission interpreted \u201cunreasonable harm\u201d to mean anticompetitive behavior. And under that interpretation, the Agreement was lawful because the postage was priced above cost.\nThe Commission cited Professor Panzar for additional support, but it did not entirely embrace his testimony. We do not think an agency decision can rise or fall with its faithfulness to every authority it cites but does not entirely rely upon. See Kennecott Greens Creek Mining Co. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 476 F.3d 946, 954 (D.C.Cir.2007). Here, the Commission relied on antitrust law and, on that basis, rationally explained the interpretation it applied.\nThe Commission also concluded that, as the statute required, the Agreement would result in a net benefit to the Postal Service. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622(c)(10)(A). The Commission first explained that the Agreement\u2019s discounts apply only to postage purchased in excess of Valassis\u2019s current mailing volumes. In that way, the Agreement was specifically designed to offer discounted postage for \u201cvolumes generated in response to the discount\u201d and not for \u201cvolume that would have been mailed\u201d anyway. Valassis Order 17.\nThe Newspapers accept this logic. But they claim that gains from Valassis\u2019s expenditures will be more than offset by reduced postage expenditures by mailers not party to the Agreement. See 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3010.42(f)(3) (requiring the Commission to consider this effect). They argue that if Valassis can send advertising through the mail more cheaply, then it can charge less to its advertisers and thereby cause its competitors (chiefly, newspapers) to lose market share. Less market share means less mail to send and less money spent on postage. The Newspapers estimated that this effect would lead newspapers to reduce postage expenditures by $199 million annually over the three-year life of the Agreement. The Commission found that projection to be unsupported.\nWhen, as here, an agency is making \u201cpredictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule,\u201d we are particularly loath to second-guess its analysis. Nat\u2019l Tel. Coop. Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 563 F.3d 536, 541 (D.C.Cir.2009). Such calculations fall \u201csquarely within the ambit of [the Commission\u2019s] expertise.\u201d Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C.Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622. Our narrow task here is to ensure that the Commission sufficiently supported its analysis. See Nat\u2019l Tel. Coop. Ass\u2019n, 563 F.3d at 540-41. We believe it did.\nThe Commission identified limitations on the accuracy of the newspapers\u2019 projections. Primarily, given newspapers\u2019 recent financial struggles, see Nick Gamse, Note, Legal Remedies for Saving Public Interest Journalism in America, 105 Nw. U.L.Rev. 329, 331-33 (2011), it is difficult to attribute a drop in postage expenditures to one particular pricing arrangement. As the Commission observed, the individual newspapers that submitted comments to the Commission seemed to ignore that complexity. Many papers projected, with little support, only the very worst case \u2014 that approval of the Agreement would cause them to reduce their postage expenditures to, or near, zero. Given the Commission\u2019s explanation of the complexities involved in making these projections, we cannot disturb its finding that the projections here were too speculative to be useful.\nThe Commission was also required to consider \u201cthe policies of [Title 39]\u201d in assessing the Agreement. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622(e)(10), (14). (Title 39 of the U.S.Code contains federal postal law.) The Newspapers contend again, now under this provision, that the Commission failed to consider the impact of the Agreement on newspapers\u2019 survival in the marketplace. For much of our nation\u2019s history, postal policy has subsidized the mailing of newspapers in recognition of the virtues of a well-informed electorate. See Note, Second-Class Postal Rates and the First Amendment, 28 Rutgers L.Rev. 693, 695-96 & n. 14 (1975). It is a small jump to conclude that a postal rate that potentially harms newspapers as a business might run counter to those policies.\nBut the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act considerably revised Title 39 with an eye toward ensuring the Postal Service\u2019s financial viability. See S.Rep. No. 108-318, at 2-4 (2004). Now, Title 39 reflects the Postal Service\u2019s need to increase revenue through negotiated service agreements. According to the Commission, Title 39 does not include a policy of protecting newspapers \u201cfrom the consequences of fair competition.\u201d Valassis Order 33. In light of the 2006 Act, we see no basis for disagreeing with the Commission\u2019s conclusion. Cf. U.S. Postal Serv. v. Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 676 F.3d 1105, 1108 (D.C.Cir.2012).\nWe also believe that the Commission gave \u201cdue regard\u201d to the Agreement\u2019s impact on small business concerns. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3642(b)(3)(C). By its terms, this provision does not impose a substantive limitation on the Commission\u2019s decision-making. It requires only that the decision \u201caddress certain legally delineated topics.\u201d Nat'l Tel. Coop. Ass\u2019n, 563 F.3d at 540. Here, the Commission concluded that the Agreement\u2019s impact on small business would be cabined because of geographic and advertising limitations built into the Agreement. That analysis considers the issue sufficiently and constitutes the requisite \u201cdue regard.\u201d\nIV\nThe Commission\u2019s order complies with the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. We have considered and rejected the other arguments made against the Commission\u2019s order. We therefore deny the petition for review.\nSo ordered.\n. Additional statutory requirements not relevant here apply to the setting of all rates. See, e.g., 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 403(c), 404a(a)(1).\n. For the full order, see Valassis Direct Mail, Inc., Dkt. MC2012-14 (Postal Regulatory Comm'n Aug. 23, 2012) (order), available at http://www.prc.gov/Docs/85/85014/Order_No_ 1448.pdf.\n. The Governors appoint the Postmaster General, 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(c), and the Governors together with the Postmaster General appoint the Deputy, id. \u00a7 202(d). So the Postmaster General and his Deputy, although members of the Board of Governors, are not Governors.\n.This power includes, among many other things, the power to establish post offices; investigate postal crimes; and prescribe the details of mail collection, handling, delivery, forwarding and returning. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(a)(1)-(8).\n. We quote in substantial part the Commission\u2019s response to Valpak\u2019s delegation argument:\nThe Postal Service responds by stating \"the Governors did authorize the Postal Service to enter into this [Agreement] and reviewed the specific terms and prices that would be charged prior to filing the Notice.\u201d Postal Service Comments at 19. It correctly references Governors\u2019 Resolution No. 11-4 ... which obviates the need for a separate specific authorization for every contract consistent with that resolution.\nValassis Direct Mail, Inc., Dkt. MC2012-14, at 9 n. 14 (Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n Aug. 23, 2012) (order), available at http://www.prc. gov/Docs/85/85014/Order_No_1448.pdf. The Commission\u2019s language is not a model of clarity, but it expresses no doubt about the veracity of the Postal Service\u2019s claim. Acknowledging this uncontested fact sufficed to allow the Commission to move past the delegation issue. Whether the Commission also meant to pronounce on the validity of Resolution 11-4 is unclear. We would have expected a much more thorough legal analysis had it intended to do so.\n. Typically, we would first have considered whether the intervenors could raise this argument at all. The rule in this circuit is that intervenors may not raise issues not already brought before the court by a petitioner. See New York v. Reilly, 969 F.2d 1147, 1154 n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1992); Ill. Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 911 F.2d 776, 786 (D.C.Cir.1990). But see Synovus Fin. Corp. v. Bd. of Governors, 952 F.2d 426, 433-34 (D.C.Cir.1991) (describing that rule as \"prudential\u201d and subject to appropriate exceptions). However, since we do not reach the merits of the intervenors\u2019 argument, we assume arguendo that the argument is properly before us.\n. Once the Act\u2019s statutory scheme replaced the existing regulatory scheme for governing negotiated service agreements, both regulations were \"rendered obsolete\u201d and removed. Updates to Rules of Practice, 74 Fed.Reg. 23,113 (May 18, 2009).\n. The intervenors (and the Newspapers to a certain extent) also make the point that newspapers can themselves be considered competitors of either the Postal Service or Valassis. They compete with the Postal Service in the market to deliver advertisements to consumers, and they compete with Valassis in the market to sell space in which to place an advertisement. So had the Commission, as Professor Panzar suggested, concerned itself with the Agreement\u2019s effects on Valassis's, but not the Service\u2019s, competitors, it would first have had to justify placing newspapers in one group or the other. However, since we conclude that the standard the Commission chose did not require a consideration of the Agreement\u2019s effects on either group, the point is of little importance here.\n. The price of the postage confirms only that the Postal Service was not employing anti-competitive tactics; it says nothing about Va-lassis. But the Newspapers do not accuse Valassis of unfair competition. And counsel for the Commission confirmed at oral argument that if Valassis were to engage in predatory pricing (or any other anticompetitive tactic) on the strength of its favorable postal rates, standard antitrust remedies would be available.\n. In addition, the Commission noted that any competitive advantage conferred upon Valassis by the Agreement would be dulled by the statutory requirement that the benefits of the deal be made available \"on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers.\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622(c)(10).\n. Only intervenors raised this argument. However, because we would reject it in any event, we assume arguendo that we may consider it.",
